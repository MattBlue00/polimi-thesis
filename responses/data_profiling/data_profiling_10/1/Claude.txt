I'll help you profile this dataset. Here's a high-level analysis:

1. Number of Records: Approximately 100 entries

2. Columns (12):
- brokered_by
- status
- price
- bed
- bath
- acre_lot
- street
- city
- state
- zip_code
- house_size
- prev_sold_date

3. Data Quality Issues:

Missing Values:
- Empty cells represented as blank, nan, -, or Unknown
- Missing values present in all columns
- Some zip codes are marked as -1
- House sizes sometimes shown as -1

Format Inconsistencies:
- Status: mixed formats (sold, for_sale, s, f, Unknown)
- Price: some entries with $ symbol, some as plain numbers
- Bed/Bath: mix of numeric and text (three, two, etc.)
- State: mix of full names, abbreviations
- Dates: multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY)

Invalid Values:
- Negative values in price and house_size
- Unrealistic bed/bath counts (e.g., 12 bathrooms)
- Invalid state names (e.g., "Texss", "Oklaoma")
- Malformed zip codes

Duplicates:
- Some entries appear to be duplicates (e.g., multiple entries for address "553 Third Ct")

4. Value Ranges:
- Price: From around $25,000 to over $20 million
- Bedrooms: 1-11 (excluding invalid entries)
- Bathrooms: 1-12 (excluding invalid entries)
- Acre_lot: From very small (0.0033) to large plots (69.0)
- House_size: From around 300 to over 11,000 sq ft

5. Common Values:
- Status: "sold" and "for_sale" are most common
- Bed: 3 bedrooms is most frequent
- Bath: 2 bathrooms is most frequent
- State: Multiple entries for Texas, California, Missouri

This dataset would need significant cleaning before analysis, including:
- Standardizing formats
- Handling missing values
- Correcting invalid entries
- Resolving duplicates
- Validating extreme values
