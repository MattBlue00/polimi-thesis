Yes, I can perform data profiling for the given dataset. Data profiling is an essential step in understanding and analyzing datasets before performing any further operations like cleaning or modeling.

Here's a summary of some key statistics from your dataset:

* Number of rows: 100 (excluding header)
* Columns with missing values:
	+ brokered\_by: 1 row has value -1
	+ status: 1 row has value -
	+ price: 1 row has value nan, 1 row starts with $ sign but not complete
	+ bed: 1 row has value -, 1 row has value nan
	+ bath: 1 row has value nan
	+ acre\_lot: 1 row has value nan, 1 row has value -
	+ street: 1 row has value Unknown
	+ city: 1 row has value Texas, 1 row has value Texaa
	+ state: 1 row has value unknown, 1 row has value WY
	+ zip\_code: 1 row has value nan, 1 row has value -
	+ house\_size: 1 row has value nan
	+ prev\_sold\_date: 1 row has value Unknown

Some other observations include:

* The column "brokered\_by" contains mostly numeric values except one instance where it is marked as "-".
* The "status" column also contains mixed types including "-" which might be considered invalid.
* There seems to be inconsistent formatting for prices ($ symbol sometimes present).
* Some columns have non-standard entries such as 'unknown', '-', etc., that need proper handling during preprocessing.
* Date formats vary across different records.

To proceed with more detailed analysis or transformation steps based on these insights would require additional context about what specific tasks will follow after profiling. However, if needed, we could clean up inconsistencies, handle missing values appropriately, convert date strings into standard datetime format among others depending upon requirements. Let me know how else I may assist!
