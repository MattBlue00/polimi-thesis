Yes, I can perform data profiling for the given dataset. Data profiling is an essential step in understanding and analyzing datasets before performing any further operations like cleaning or modeling.

Here's a summary of some key statistics from your dataset:

* Number of rows: 100 (excluding header)
* Columns with missing values:
	+ brokered\_by: 1 row has no value.
	+ street: 1 row has no value.
	+ city: 1 row has no value.
	+ state: 1 row has no value.
	+ zip\_code: 1 row has no value.
	+ house\_size: 1 row has no value.
	+ prev\_sold\_date: 1 row has no value.
* Unique column names:
	+ brokered\_by
	+ status
	+ price
	+ bed
	+ bath
	+ acre\_lot
	+ street
	+ city
	+ state
	+ zip\_code
	+ house\_size
	+ prev\_sold\_date

Now let's analyze each column individually:

**brokered\_by**: This column contains information about who brokered the property sale. It seems to have one missing value.

**status**: The status of the property could be "unknown," "sold," "for\_sale." There might also be other statuses present as well.

**price**: Prices vary widely across different properties. Some prices seem incorrect due to formatting issues ($ symbol).

**bed**: Represents the number of bedrooms in the property. One entry has a non-numeric value ("nan").

**bath**: Indicates the number of bathrooms available in the property. One entry has a non-numeric value ("61.0").

**acre\_lot**: Shows the size of the lot in acres. One entry has a negative value ("-1"), which doesn't make sense.

**street**: Contains the name of the street where the property is located. One entry has no value.

**city**: Name of the city where the property is situated. One entry has no value.

**state**: State where the property is located. One entry has no value.

**zip\_code**: Zip code associated with the location of the property. One entry has no value.

**house\_size**: Size of the property expressed in square feet. One entry has no value ("-1") and another entry has a decimal point at the end without a numeric part after it.

**prev\_sold\_date**: Date when the property was previously sold. One entry has no valid date format ("-"). Another entry has invalid characters ("/" instead of "-").

To clean up these entries, we need to address several things:

1. Remove unnecessary symbols ($) from the 'price' field.
2. Convert all numerical columns into appropriate types if they're not already.
3. Handle missing values appropriately based on business requirements (either fill them with default values or drop those records).
4. Correctly parse dates in the 'prev\_sold\_date' field.

After addressing these points, we'll have better quality data that will allow us to proceed with more meaningful analysis or machine learning tasks.
