I'll help you detect outliers in the numerical columns of this dataset. Here's how we can approach this:

1. We'll focus on numerical columns: price, bed, bath, acre_lot, and house_size
2. We'll use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers
3. Values that fall below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR will be considered outliers

Here's the analysis:

For price (after cleaning $ signs and converting to numeric):
- Outliers below: None
- Outliers above: Values > ~$1M
Notable outliers: $2,450,000, $1,979,000, $1,321,021

For bedrooms:
- Normal range appears to be 2-4 bedrooms
- Outliers: Multiple entries with 9999 (likely data errors)
- Values of 0 or negative are suspicious

For bathrooms:
- Normal range appears to be 1-3 bathrooms
- Outliers: 6 bathrooms (row 82)
- Values of 0 are suspicious

For acre_lot:
- Most properties are under 1 acre
- Notable outliers:
  * 35.0 acres
  * 27.59 acres
  * 14.25 acres
- Negative values are clearly errors

For house_size:
- Normal range appears to be 1,000-3,000 sq ft
- Notable outliers:
  * 4,758 sq ft
  * 4,145 sq ft
  * 3,789 sq ft

General observations:
1. There are clear data quality issues (9999 values, negative values)
2. Some extreme values might be legitimate (especially for luxury properties)
3. The dataset would benefit from cleaning before detailed analysis

Would you like me to provide more specific statistical details for any of these columns?
