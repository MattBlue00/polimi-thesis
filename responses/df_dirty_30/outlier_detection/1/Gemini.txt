The dataset provided has several issues that make direct outlier detection challenging.  Here's a breakdown of the problems and a suggested approach:

**Data Quality Issues:**

* **Mixed Data Types:** The `price` column contains both numeric values and strings with dollar signs.  `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `zip_code`, and `house_size` have similar issues with hyphens, "NaN," and potentially incorrect data types.
* **Missing Values:** Many missing values are represented by various placeholders (NaN, -, blank).
* **Inconsistent Formatting:** Dates are in different formats.
* **Invalid Values:**  `bed` and `bath` contain the value 9999, which is likely a placeholder for missing data but will skew numerical analysis.  Similarly, negative values for `acre_lot` are problematic.

**Outlier Detection Strategy:**

1. **Data Cleaning:** This is the most crucial step.
    * **Price:** Remove dollar signs and convert to numeric.
    * **Numeric Columns:** Replace hyphens, blanks, and 9999 with NaN. Convert columns to the correct numeric type (e.g., float64).  Investigate and correct negative `acre_lot` values if possible; otherwise, consider treating them as missing data.
    * **Dates:** Standardize the date format.
    * **Categorical Columns:** Handle missing values in categorical columns (brokered_by, street, city, state, etc.) consistently, either by imputation or creating a "Missing" category.
2. **Outlier Detection Methods (after cleaning):**
    * **Visual Inspection (Box Plots, Scatter Plots):**  Create visualizations for numerical features like `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size` to identify potential outliers.
    * **Z-score:** Calculate the Z-score for each numerical feature. Values with a Z-score above a certain threshold (e.g., 3) can be considered outliers.  This method assumes a normal distribution, which might not be the case for all features.
    * **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Calculate the IQR (Q3 - Q1) and identify values outside the range Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR as outliers. This method is less sensitive to extreme values than the Z-score.
    * **Clustering-based methods (DBSCAN):**  These methods can identify data points that don't belong to any cluster and can be effective for high-dimensional data. However, they require careful parameter tuning.
3. **Handling Outliers:**
    * **Removal:**  Remove outliers if they are clearly data errors.
    * **Transformation:** Apply transformations like log transformation to reduce the impact of extreme values.
    * **Imputation:** Replace outliers with a more reasonable value (e.g., the mean, median, or a value at the edge of the acceptable range).
    * **Separate Analysis:**  Analyze the data with and without outliers to understand their impact on the results.

**Example Data Cleaning in Python (using pandas):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")  # Replace "your_data.csv" with your file name

# Clean 'price'
df['price'] = df['price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)

# Clean numeric columns
numeric_cols = ['bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']
for col in numeric_cols:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(str).str.replace('-', 'NaN', regex=False).astype(float)
    df[col] = df[col].replace(9999, np.nan)

# Standardize dates (example, assuming mm/dd/yy format for non-yyyy-mm-dd)
def standardize_date(date_str):
    try:
        return pd.to_datetime(date_str)
    except:
        try:
            return pd.to_datetime(date_str, format='%m/%d/%y')
        except:
            return np.nan

df['prev_sold_date'] = df['prev_sold_date'].apply(standardize_date)

# ... (Handle missing values in categorical columns as needed) ...

# Now you can proceed with outlier detection methods.
```

This cleaned data will be much more suitable for outlier analysis. Remember to choose the outlier detection and handling methods that are most appropriate for your specific goals and the characteristics of your data.  Don't automatically remove outliers unless you're sure they are errors. They might contain valuable information.
