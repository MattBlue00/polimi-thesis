I can help you with data imputation for this dataset. Here's a strategy we can use:

1. For categorical columns (brokered_by, status, street, city, state):
   - Fill missing values with the mode (most frequent value)
   - For 'status', standardize values (s -> sold, f -> for_sale)

2. For numerical columns (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size):
   - Remove dollar signs and convert to numeric
   - Replace invalid values (-1.24, 9999, etc.) with NaN
   - Fill missing values with median
   - Round to reasonable decimals

3. For date columns (prev_sold_date):
   - Standardize date format
   - Fill missing dates with median date

4. For zip_code:
   - Convert to string
   - Fill missing with mode

Would you like me to proceed with this imputation strategy? I can provide the Python code and the imputed dataset.

Note: Some assumptions will need to be made about what constitutes invalid data (e.g., what acre_lot values are reasonable, what's the maximum reasonable number of bedrooms, etc.). Would you like me to proceed with specific thresholds, or would you prefer to specify them?
