Here's a step-by-step approach to imputing the missing data in this dataset, along with explanations of the choices made:

**1. Analyze the Data and Missingness:**

* **Identify Data Types:**  We have a mix of numerical (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, zip_code, house_size), categorical (brokered_by, status, street, city, state), and date (prev_sold_date) data.
* **Missingness Patterns:**  Missing values are represented by "-", "NaN", and blank cells.  We need to standardize these to a single representation (e.g., NaN).
* **Relationships:** Look for potential relationships between columns. For example, `price` might be related to `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`, `city`, and `state`.  `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code` are also related.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

* **Standardize Missing Values:** Replace "-", blank cells, and potentially "9999" (which seems to be a placeholder for missing numerical data) with `NaN` using pandas or your preferred data manipulation library.
* **Data Type Conversion:**
    * Convert `price` to numeric, removing '$' and commas.
    * Convert `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `zip_code`, and `house_size` to numeric.
    * Convert `prev_sold_date` to datetime objects.
* **Address Cleanup:** If possible, use external resources (e.g., geocoding APIs) to fill in missing `city`, `state`, and `zip_code` based on `street` information.  This is often the most reliable way to impute address data.

**3. Imputation Strategies:**

* **Numerical Features:**
    * **`price`:**  This is a crucial feature. Consider imputing using a model-based approach (e.g., regression) using features like `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`, `city`, and `state`.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation could also be effective.  Mean/median imputation is less desirable due to the likely skew in house prices.
    * `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`:**  KNN imputation or a model-based approach would be suitable.  If the missingness is related to the property type (e.g., condos might not have `acre_lot`), consider imputing with a value representing "not applicable" (e.g., 0 or a separate category) after careful consideration.
* **Categorical Features:**
    * **`brokered_by`:** If a significant number of transactions are not brokered, create a category like "Not Brokered." Otherwise, mode imputation might be reasonable.
    * **`status`:** Mode imputation is a good starting point.
    * **`street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`:** As mentioned, leverage geocoding APIs if possible.  If not, mode imputation for `city` and `state` might be the best option, though it could introduce bias.
* **Date Feature:**
    * **`prev_sold_date`:**  If the date is missing, it might indicate the property is newly built or hasn't been sold recently.  Creating a separate category (e.g., "No Previous Sale") could be useful.  Alternatively, if you have other time-related information, you could try to estimate the sale date.

**4. Evaluation and Refinement:**

* **Post-Imputation Analysis:** Examine the distributions of the imputed variables.  Compare them to the original distributions (where available) to ensure the imputation hasn't introduced significant bias.
* **Model Performance:** If you plan to use this data for predictive modeling, evaluate the performance of your model with different imputation methods.  This will help you choose the most effective strategy.
* **Iterative Imputation:**  For complex datasets, consider iterative imputation methods (e.g., Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations - MICE) which can handle different data types and complex relationships.

**Example Code Snippet (pandas):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# ... (load your data into a pandas DataFrame called 'df')

# Standardize missing values
df.replace(["-", "", "9999"], np.nan, inplace=True)

# Convert data types
df['price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True))
# ... (similar conversions for other numeric columns)
df['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['prev_sold_date'], errors='coerce')

# ... (Imputation using KNN or other methods - see libraries like scikit-learn)
```

This detailed breakdown provides a robust framework for imputing the missing data in your dataset. Remember to carefully consider the implications of each imputation choice and evaluate the results thoroughly.  The best approach will depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.
