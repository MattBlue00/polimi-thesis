I'll help you with data imputation for this dataset. Let's break it down into steps:

1. First, let's analyze the types of missing values:
- Missing values are represented as NaN, '-', and some numeric fields have 9999
- Some price values have '$' symbol
- Some dates are in different formats

2. Let's identify the columns that need imputation:
- brokered_by: categorical
- status: categorical
- price: numerical
- bed: numerical
- bath: numerical
- acre_lot: numerical
- street: categorical
- city: categorical
- state: categorical
- zip_code: categorical
- house_size: numerical
- prev_sold_date: date

3. Recommended imputation strategies:

a) For numerical columns:
- price: Median imputation after removing '$' and converting to float
- bed: Remove 9999 values, then median imputation
- bath: Median imputation
- acre_lot: Remove negative values (likely errors), then median imputation
- house_size: Convert scientific notation to regular numbers, then median imputation

b) For categorical columns:
- brokered_by: Mode imputation or "Unknown"
- status: Mode imputation (after standardizing 's' to 'sold' and 'f' to 'for_sale')
- street/city/state/zip_code: "Unknown" for missing values
- prev_sold_date: Convert to consistent date format, then median date

4. Special considerations:
- Remove duplicate rows (e.g., rows 4 and 13 appear identical)
- Handle outliers in price and acre_lot
- Standardize status values ('s' → 'sold', 'f' → 'for_sale')
- Convert house_size from scientific notation
- Remove negative acre_lot values as they're likely errors
