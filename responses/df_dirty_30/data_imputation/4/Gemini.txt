The dataset provided has several data quality issues, including missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers. Here's a step-by-step approach to data imputation and cleaning:

**1. Understand the Data:**

*   **Columns:** `brokered_by`, `status`, `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `house_size`, `prev_sold_date`
*   **Data Types:**
    *   **Numerical:** `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `zip_code`, `house_size`
    *   **Categorical:** `brokered_by`, `status`, `street`, `city`, `state`
    *   **Date:** `prev_sold_date`
*   **Missing Values:** Present in most columns.
*   **Inconsistent Formatting:** `price` has '$' signs, `status` has variations ('sold', 's', 'for\_sale', 'f'), numerical columns sometimes store numerical values as strings.
*   **Outliers:** `bed` and `bath` have the value 9999, likely representing missing data. `acre_lot` has both negative and very large values, requiring investigation.

**2. Data Cleaning:**

*   **`price`:**
    *   Remove '$' signs.
    *   Convert to numerical data type (float or integer).
*   **`status`:**
    *   Standardize values: 'sold', 'for\_sale'.  Consider dropping rows with status '-' as they don't provide useful information.
*   **`bed`, `bath`:** Replace 9999 with NaN.
*   **`acre_lot`:** Investigate negative and large values.  Negative values might represent an error or a specific coding.  Large values could be legitimate or errors. Domain expertise is needed here.  If confirmed errors, correct or impute if possible.
*   **`zip_code`:** Convert to string data type. Ensure consistent length (add leading zeros if necessary).
*   **`house_size`:** Convert to numerical data type.
*   **`prev_sold_date`:** Convert to datetime data type. Standardize the format.
*   **`brokered_by`:** If possible, replace broker IDs with actual names or keep IDs if they are consistent.  Hyphens likely represent missing values and should be replaced with NaN.
*   **Missing `city` and `state`:** Impute based on `zip_code` if possible. External datasets or APIs can be used for this.
*   **`street`:**  Consider if this information is crucial. If not, and if a significant portion is missing, the column could be dropped. If crucial, imputation is complex and might not be reliable.

**3. Imputation Strategies:**

*   **Numerical (`price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`):**
    *   **Mean/Median Imputation:** Simple, but can distort the distribution if many values are missing.  Median is more robust to outliers.
    *   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:**  More sophisticated, considers similar data points.
    *   **Regression Imputation:** Predict missing values based on other variables.
*   **Categorical (`status`, `city`, `state`):**
    *   **Mode Imputation:** Use the most frequent category.
    *   **Classification:** Predict the missing category based on other variables.
*   **Date (`prev_sold_date`):**
    *   If related to other date fields, impute based on those relationships.
    *   If no clear relationship, consider dropping rows if the date is crucial for the analysis.

**4. Evaluation:**

After imputation, assess the impact on the data distribution and relationships between variables. Compare imputed values with original values (if available) to evaluate the accuracy of the imputation method.

**Example Implementation (Python with Pandas):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# ... (Data cleaning steps as described above) ...

# Example imputation using median for 'bed'
df['bed'] = df['bed'].replace(9999, np.nan)
df['bed'] = df['bed'].fillna(df['bed'].median())

# ... (Other imputation steps) ...

# Save the cleaned and imputed data
df.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
```

This detailed breakdown provides a structured approach to data imputation and cleaning for the given dataset. Remember to choose imputation methods appropriate for each variable and carefully evaluate the results.  The specific implementation will depend on the tools used and the ultimate goals of the analysis.
