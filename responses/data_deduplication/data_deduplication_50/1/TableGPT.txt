Yes, I can help with that.

To perform data deduplication, we need to identify and remove duplicate rows from the provided dataset while keeping only one instance of each unique row. We'll focus on all columns except for `prev_sold_date` since dates might be different even if other details remain identical (assuming these differences in date don't matter).

Here's how we can proceed:

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Drop duplicates based on all columns except `prev_sold_date`.
3. Output the resulting DataFrame without duplicates.

Let me show you an example code snippet using Python and pandas library to achieve this task:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data loading - replace 'data.csv' with your actual file path or content
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Dropping duplicates excluding 'prev_sold_date'
deduplicated_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=df.columns.difference(['prev_sold_date']))

print(deduplicated_df)
```

This script will load the data, drop any duplicate rows based on all columns except `prev_sold_date`, and print out the result. If you have the full dataset available, please upload it so I can run the exact operation on your data. Otherwise, feel free to provide more context about where the data is coming from or what format it's in, and I'd be happy to assist further!
