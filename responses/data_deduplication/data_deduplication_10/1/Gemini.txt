import pandas as pd

# Load the data

df = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(data), sep=';')

# Convert prev_sold_date to datetime objects for accurate comparison
df['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['prev_sold_date'], errors='coerce')


# Deduplicate the data, keeping the first occurrence
deduplicated_df = df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')

# Print the deduplicated data (optional - for verification)
print(deduplicated_df)

# Save the deduplicated data to a new CSV file (optional)
deduplicated_df.to_csv('deduplicated_data.csv', index=False, sep=';') 
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Loading with StringIO:**  The code now uses `pd.compat.StringIO` to load the data directly from the string you provided, making it more convenient.

2. **Date Handling:** The `prev_sold_date` column is converted to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime`. The `errors='coerce'` argument handles potential invalid date formats by setting them to `NaT` (Not a Time). This is crucial for accurate deduplication, as string comparisons of dates can be unreliable.

3. **Deduplication:** The core deduplication is done using `df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')`. This removes rows that are completely identical to a previous row, keeping the first occurrence.

4. **Optional Output:** The code includes optional lines to print the deduplicated DataFrame to the console and to save it to a new CSV file named "deduplicated_data.csv".  The separator is set to ';' to match the input format.

5. **Fuzzy Matching (for slight variations):**  Your data has some near-duplicates (e.g., slightly different spellings of city names, slightly different acre_lot values, or typos in dates).  If you want to handle these, you'll need fuzzy matching.  Here's an example using the `fuzzywuzzy` library (you'll need to install it: `pip install fuzzywuzzy`):

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import process, fuzz

# ... (previous code) ...

# Example: Fuzzy matching on the 'city' column
def fuzzy_match_city(city, choices, scorer=fuzz.token_sort_ratio):
    return process.extractOne(city, choices, scorer=scorer)

unique_cities = deduplicated_df['city'].unique()

df['fuzzy_city_match'] = df['city'].apply(lambda x: fuzzy_match_city(x, unique_cities))

# Now you can use 'fuzzy_city_match' to group and deduplicate based on similarity
# ... (more complex logic to decide how to merge/deduplicate based on fuzzy matches)
```

Fuzzy matching is more complex and requires careful consideration of which columns to use, the scoring function, and the threshold for similarity.  You'll need to adapt it to your specific needs.


This improved code provides a more robust and flexible solution for data deduplication, addressing date handling and offering a starting point for handling near-duplicates with fuzzy matching.
