Yes, I can perform data deduplication on the given dataset. Data deduplication involves removing duplicate records from the dataset while preserving unique records. To achieve this, we can use various techniques such as hash-based deduplication or record-based deduplication.

In this case, since the dataset contains information about houses, we can consider using record-based deduplication. This involves comparing each record in the dataset and identifying those that have identical values across all columns. Once duplicates are identified, they can be removed, leaving only unique records.

Here's an example of how the deduplicated dataset might look:

| brokered_by | status | price | bed | bath | acre_lot | street | city | state | zip_code | house_size | prev_sold_date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 54093 | for_sale | 265000 | 1 | 1 | 0.03 | 896 Sunset Ct | Marathon | Florida | 33050 | 321 | 2004-09-20 |
| 81316 | sold | 749000 | 4 | 2 | 0.27 | 285 Center Ln | Fairfax | Virginia | 22030 | 2948 | 2021-12-10 |
| 96817 | sold | 425000 | 4 | 3 | 0.06 | 33 Pine Ave | Alexandria | Virginia | 22309 | 2075 | 2022-02-04 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

By removing duplicate records, we can ensure that the dataset contains only unique listings, which can help improve data quality and reduce redundancy.
