Yes, I can help with that.

To perform data deduplication, we need to identify and remove duplicate rows from the provided dataset while preserving unique entries. We'll focus on all columns except for `prev_sold_date` since dates might be different even if other details match (e.g., house sold twice at different times).

Here's how we can proceed:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
data = {
    'brokered_by': [54093, 81316, ...], # Insert your full list of values here.
    'status': ['for_sale', 'sold', ...],
    'price': [265000, 749000, ...],
    'bed': [1, 4, ...],
    'bath': [1, 2, ...],
    'acre_lot': [0.03, 0.27, ...],
    'street': ['896 Sunset Ct', '285 Center Ln', ...],
    'city': ['Marathon', 'Fairfax', ...],
    'state': ['Florida', 'Virginia', ...],
    'zip_code': [33050, 22030, ...],
    'house_size': [321, 2948, ...],
    'prev_sold_date': ['2004-09-20', '2021-12-10', ...]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Perform deduplication based on all columns except prev_sold_date
deduplicated_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['brokered_by', 'status', 'price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'house_size'])

print(deduplicated_df)
```

This code will load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and then use the `drop_duplicates()` method to eliminate duplicates based on specified columns (`subset`). The result is stored in `deduplicated_df`, which contains only unique records according to those criteria.

Please note: This example assumes you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries like Pandas. Also, replace `[...]` placeholders with actual data points when running the script. If there are any specific requirements or constraints regarding what constitutes a "duplicate" row, please let me know so I can adjust accordingly!
