Yes, I can help with that.

To perform data deduplication, we need to identify and remove duplicate rows from the provided dataset while preserving unique entries. We'll focus on removing duplicates based on all columns except for `prev_sold_date`, as dates might differ even if other details remain identical (e.g., different sold dates but same house information).

Here's how we can proceed:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
data = {
    'brokered_by': [78247, 26012, ...], # Insert your full list of brokered_by values here.
    'status': ['sold', 'sold', ...],
    'price': [339900, 259900, ...],
    'bed': [3, 4, ...],
    'bath': [2, 2, ...],
    'acre_lot': [0.28, 0.13, ...],
    'street': ['676 South Blvd', '391 Bridge Rd', ...],
    'city': ['Troy', 'Great Falls', ...],
    'state': ['Illinois', 'Montana', ...],
    'zip_code': [62294, 59405, ...],
    'house_size': [1613, 1632, ...],
    'prev_sold_date': ['2022-01-26', '2021-11-09', ...]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Perform deduplication excluding 'prev_sold_date'
deduplicated_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['brokered_by', 'status', 'price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'house_size'])

print(deduplicated_df)
```

Please replace `[...]` in the dictionary above with the actual values from your dataset. This code will load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and then drop any duplicate rows based on specified columns, keeping only one instance of each set of duplicated records.

If there is anything specific or additional processing required, please let me know!
