df = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(data), sep=';')

# Deduplicate based on all columns
deduped_df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Print the deduplicated DataFrame
print(deduped_df)

# If you want to save it to a new CSV file:
deduped_df.to_csv('deduped_dataset.csv', index=False, sep=';') 


# Example of deduplicating based on a subset of columns (e.g., street, city, state):
deduped_by_address = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['street', 'city', 'state'])
print("\nDeduplicated by address:\n", deduped_by_address)


# Example of keeping the last occurrence of a duplicate:
deduped_last_occurrence = df.drop_duplicates(keep='last')
print("\nDeduplicated keeping last occurrence:\n", deduped_last_occurrence)

```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Using pandas:**  pandas is the most efficient way to handle this kind of data manipulation in Python.
2. **StringIO:** The `pd.compat.StringIO` allows you to read the data directly from the string you provided, making the code self-contained and easier to run.
3. **`drop_duplicates()`:** This is the core pandas function for deduplication. By default, it considers all columns.
4. **`subset` argument:** The code now shows how to deduplicate based on a specific set of columns (like address). This is very useful if you want to remove duplicates based on a particular criteria.
5. **`keep` argument:** The code demonstrates how to keep the 'last' occurrence of a duplicate if needed.  The default is `'first'`.
6. **Saving to CSV:** The code includes how to save the deduplicated DataFrame back to a CSV file using the same separator as the original.
7. **Clearer output:** The `print` statements are more informative, showing what type of deduplication was performed.


**How to use it:**

1. **Copy and paste the code** into a Python environment (like a Jupyter notebook or a Python script).
2. **Replace the sample data string** with your actual data.
3. **Run the code.** The deduplicated DataFrame will be printed, and optionally saved to a CSV file.


This improved version is more flexible, efficient, and provides more control over the deduplication process.  It also handles the data directly as a DataFrame, which is the standard way to work with tabular data in pandas.
