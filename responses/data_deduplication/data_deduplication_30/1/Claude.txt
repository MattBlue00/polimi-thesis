I'll help identify and remove duplicate entries. A record can be considered a duplicate if it has the exact same values across all relevant fields. However, in real estate data, sometimes there might be slight variations in how the same property is listed (due to typos, formatting differences, etc.).

Here are some clear duplicates I found:

1. Property at "272 Terrace Ln, Orlando, Florida" (brokered_by: 687) appears 3 times with identical information
2. Property at "864 Lake Ln, Irving, Texas" (brokered_by: 3479) appears 3 times with identical information
3. Property at "162 Mill St, Tustin, California" (brokered_by: 84529) appears 2 times with identical information
4. Property at "219 Field St, Houston, Texas" (brokered_by: 16829) appears 2 times
5. Property at "88 East Ave, San Antonio, Texas" (brokered_by: 48807) appears 2 times
6. Property at "611 Hill Pl, Wichita, Kansas" (brokered_by: 53556) appears 2 times

There are also several entries that appear to be the same property but have slight variations in spelling or data entry:

1. Variations of "272 Farm Blvd, Dearborn Heights, Michigan":
   - brokered_by: 22562 (210000)
   - brokered_by: 222562 (2110000)
   - brokered_by: 2562 (21000)

2. Variations of "693 Ridge Pl, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia":
   - brokered_by: 53173
   - brokered_by: 53373
   - brokered_by: 531373

3. Variations of "217 Church Ln, Calabash, North Carolina":
   - brokered_by: 20385
   - brokered_by: 2385

To clean this dataset, you should:
1. Remove the exact duplicates
2. Review the near-duplicates and determine which entry is correct
3. Standardize state names and address formats
4. Fix obvious typos in city names and zip codes

Would you like me to provide a cleaned version of the dataset with these corrections applied?
