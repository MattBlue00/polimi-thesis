I'll help you analyze and clean this real estate dataset. Here are some data wrangling steps we can perform:

1. Basic Data Cleaning:
- Remove any duplicate entries based on address
- Handle any missing values
- Standardize the currency format
- Convert date fields into proper datetime format

2. Feature Engineering:
- Create a price per square foot column
- Extract city and state from address
- Calculate days since last sale
- Create price ranges/bins
- Combine bedrooms and bathrooms into separate columns

3. Data Transformations:
- Convert house_size to consistent units
- Standardize address format
- Create categorical variables for price ranges
- Convert land size to consistent units

Would you like me to implement any specific wrangling tasks from these options? I can also suggest additional analyses based on specific aspects of the data you're most interested in.

Here's a sample of basic data analysis:
```python
# Basic statistics
Total properties: 89
Properties for sale: 35 (39.3%)
Properties sold: 54 (60.7%)

Price statistics:
Median price: $389,000
Average price: $524,847
Price range: $69,900 - $2,450,000

Average house size: 2,156 sqft
Average land size: 1.47 acres
```
