Yes, I can help with data wrangling for the provided dataset.

Data wrangling involves cleaning and transforming raw data into an understandable format to make analysis easier. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Handling missing values**: We will check if there are any null or empty cells in the dataset.
2. **Removing duplicates**: If there are duplicate rows, they will be removed.
3. **Standardizing column names**: Ensuring all columns have consistent naming conventions (e.g., lower case).
4. **Converting data types**: Converting numerical strings to actual numbers where necessary.
5. **Formatting addresses**: Standardizing address formats as needed.
6. **Other transformations**: Any other specific changes required based on your needs.

Let's start by loading the data and checking its structure first. Please provide me with access to execute code so that I can proceed with these steps.
