I'll help you profile this dataset. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

1. Dataset Dimensions:
- Number of rows: 110
- Number of columns: 11

2. Column Types:
- brokered_by: Object (string/categorical)
- status: Object (string/categorical)
- price: Mixed (string/numeric)
- bed: Mixed (numeric/string)
- bath: Mixed (numeric)
- acre_lot: Mixed (numeric)
- street: Object (string)
- city: Object (string)
- state: Object (string)
- zip_code: Mixed (string/numeric)
- house_size: Mixed (numeric/string)
- prev_sold_date: Mixed (date/string)

3. Missing Values:
- Multiple columns contain missing values (NaN, '-', empty strings)
- Notable presence of 'NaN' in city, state, and street columns
- Price contains some missing values
- house_size has several missing entries

4. Data Quality Issues:
- Inconsistent price format (some with '$' prefix)
- Mixed date formats in prev_sold_date
- Inconsistent state representations (full names vs abbreviations)
- Some invalid values (e.g., 9999 in bed column)
- Negative values in acre_lot (which shouldn't be possible)
- Some scientific notation in house_size
- Inconsistent status values ('sold', 's', 'f', 'for_sale')

5. Value Ranges:
- Price: From around $69,900 to $2,450,000
- Beds: 1-6 (excluding invalid 9999 values)
- Baths: 0-6
- Acre_lot: -1.56 to 35.0 (negative values are likely errors)
- House_size: varies significantly

6. Categorical Values:
- Status has multiple representations for same states
- States include both full names and abbreviations
- brokered_by contains both numeric IDs and full names

7. Data Standardization Needs:
- Price needs to be converted to numeric format
- Dates need standardization
- Status values need normalization
- State names need standardization
- Invalid values need to be addressed
- Negative acre_lot values need investigation

8. Recommendations:
- Clean and standardize price format
- Convert dates to a single format
- Normalize status values
- Standardize state names
- Remove or fix invalid values
- Address negative acre_lot values
- Convert house_size to consistent numeric format
- Handle missing values appropriately

This dataset would benefit from significant cleaning and standardization before analysis.
