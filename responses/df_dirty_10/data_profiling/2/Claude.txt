I'll help you profile this dataset step by step.

1. First, let's look at the basic structure:
- Number of rows: 110
- Number of columns: 11
- Columns: brokered_by, status, price, bed, bath, acre_lot, street, city, state, zip_code, house_size, prev_sold_date

2. Let's analyze each column:

a) brokered_by:
- Contains numeric IDs, names, and NaN values
- Mixed data types (strings and numbers)
- Some missing values

b) status:
- Categories: "for_sale", "sold", "s", "f", "-", NaN
- Inconsistent representations ("s" and "sold" likely mean the same thing)
- Some missing values

c) price:
- Mix of numeric values and string formats (some with "$" prefix)
- Some missing values ("-" and NaN)
- Range appears to be from around $69,900 to $2,450,000

d) bed:
- Numeric values
- Some invalid entries (9999)
- Some missing values ("-" and NaN)
- Most common range appears to be 2-5 bedrooms

e) bath:
- Numeric values
- Some missing values
- Some zeros
- Most common range appears to be 1-4 bathrooms

f) acre_lot:
- Numeric values
- Some negative values (likely errors)
- Some missing values
- Range varies significantly (from small lots to 35 acres)

g) street:
- Text data
- Some missing values (NaN, "-")
- Various street naming conventions

h) city:
- Text data
- Some missing values
- Various city names across different states

i) state:
- Mix of full state names and abbreviations
- Some missing values
- Some invalid entries ("-")

j) zip_code:
- Mix of formats (some 5-digit, some 2-digit)
- Some missing values
- Some scientific notation values

k) house_size:
- Numeric values
- Some missing values ("-" and NaN)
- Range appears to be from around 321 to 5828 square feet

l) prev_sold_date:
- Mix of date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY)
- Some missing values
- Dates range from 1991 to 2022

3. Data Quality Issues:
- Inconsistent data formats across multiple columns
- Missing values in all columns
- Invalid entries (9999 in beds, negative acre_lot values)
- Mixed data types in same columns
- Inconsistent state and zip code representations
- Different date formats
- Possible duplicate entries

4. Recommendations for Cleaning:
- Standardize status values
- Remove "$" from price and convert to numeric
- Clean invalid bed counts (9999)
- Remove negative acre_lot values
- Standardize state abbreviations
- Format zip codes consistently
- Standardize date format
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Remove or fix invalid entries
