I'll help you profile this dataset step by step.

1. Dataset Size and Structure:
- Number of rows: 110 (indices 0-109)
- Number of columns: 11 columns (brokered_by, status, price, bed, bath, acre_lot, street, city, state, zip_code, house_size, prev_sold_date)

2. Missing Values Analysis:
- brokered_by: Several NaN and "-" values
- status: Some NaN values, also abbreviated forms ('s', 'f')
- price: Mix of NaN values and different formats ($, plain numbers)
- bed: Contains NaN and invalid values (9999)
- bath: Contains NaN and invalid values (0)
- acre_lot: Contains NaN, negative values, and "-"
- street: Some NaN and "-" values
- city: Several NaN values
- state: Mix of full names and abbreviations, some NaN and "-"
- zip_code: Mix of formats, some NaN
- house_size: Mix of numeric values, NaN, and scientific notation
- prev_sold_date: Different date formats, some NaN values

3. Data Quality Issues:
a) Inconsistent Formats:
- Price: Mix of string format with $ and plain numbers
- State: Mix of full names and abbreviations (TX vs Texas)
- Dates: Multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY)
- House size: Scientific notation and regular numbers

b) Invalid Values:
- Negative acre_lot values (e.g., -0.94, -1.51)
- Bed count of 9999 (clearly invalid)
- Bath count of 0 (potentially invalid)

4. Value Distributions:
- status: Main values are "for_sale" and "sold", with abbreviated versions
- bed: Ranges mostly 1-6 (excluding invalid 9999 values)
- bath: Ranges mostly 1-6
- acre_lot: Mostly under 1 acre, with some larger lots up to 35 acres
- price: Range from around $69,900 to $2,450,000

5. Recommendations for Cleaning:
1. Standardize status values (expand abbreviations)
2. Clean price format to consistent numeric values
3. Remove or flag invalid bed/bath counts
4. Correct negative acre_lot values
5. Standardize state names
6. Convert dates to consistent format
7. Convert house_size to consistent numeric format
8. Handle missing values appropriately

6. Potential Derived Features:
- Price per square foot
- Property age (based on prev_sold_date)
- Geographic regions from state data
- Urban/rural classification based on lot size

This dataset would require significant cleaning before being used for analysis, but contains valuable real estate information once properly processed.
