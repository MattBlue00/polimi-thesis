I'll provide a comprehensive data profiling analysis of this dataset:

1. Dataset Dimensions:
- Number of rows: 110
- Number of columns: 11

2. Column Analysis:

a) brokered_by:
- Data type: Object (string/mixed)
- Missing values: 4 (3.6%)
- Contains numeric IDs and full names
- Some entries are marked as "-"

b) status:
- Data type: Object
- Missing values: 3 (2.7%)
- Unique values: ['for_sale', 'sold', 'f', 's', '-']
- Inconsistent representations ('s' for 'sold', 'f' for 'for_sale')

c) price:
- Data type: Mixed (string/numeric)
- Missing values: 6 (5.5%)
- Some values prefixed with '$'
- Some values are '-'
- Range appears to be from $69,900 to $2,450,000

d) bed:
- Data type: Numeric/Mixed
- Missing values: 5 (4.5%)
- Invalid entries: Multiple '9999' values
- Some entries marked as '-'
- Valid range appears to be 1-6 bedrooms

e) bath:
- Data type: Numeric
- Missing values: 8 (7.3%)
- Some entries marked as '0' or '-'
- Valid range appears to be 1-6 bathrooms

f) acre_lot:
- Data type: Numeric
- Missing values: 7 (6.4%)
- Contains negative values (likely errors)
- Range from -1.56 to 35.0 acres
- Some entries marked as '-'

g) street:
- Data type: Object
- Missing values: 11 (10%)
- Some entries marked as '-'
- Contains various street types (Ln, St, Ave, Blvd, etc.)

h) city:
- Data type: Object
- Missing values: 8 (7.3%)
- Some entries marked as '-'

i) state:
- Data type: Object
- Missing values: 9 (8.2%)
- Mix of full state names and abbreviations
- Some entries marked as '-'

j) zip_code:
- Data type: Mixed
- Missing values: 11 (10%)
- Some entries are incomplete (only 2 digits)
- Some entries are scientific notation
- Some entries marked as '-'

k) house_size:
- Data type: Mixed
- Missing values: 10 (9.1%)
- Some entries marked as '-'
- Range appears to be from 321 to 5828 square feet
- Some entries in scientific notation

l) prev_sold_date:
- Data type: Mixed date formats
- Missing values: 8 (7.3%)
- Multiple date formats:
  * YYYY-MM-DD
  * MM/DD/YY
  * Inconsistent separators (- and /)

3. Data Quality Issues:
1. Inconsistent value representations
2. Multiple missing value indicators (NaN, -, empty)
3. Invalid numeric values (9999 in beds)
4. Negative values in acre_lot
5. Mixed date formats
6. Scientific notation in numeric fields
7. Inconsistent state name formats
8. Mixed data types in several columns
9. Duplicate records (some properties appear multiple times)

4. Recommendations:
1. Standardize missing value representation
2. Clean and standardize status values
3. Remove '$' from price and convert to numeric
4. Clean invalid bed/bath counts
5. Remove or correct negative acre_lot values
6. Standardize date format
7. Standardize state names to either full names or abbreviations
8. Convert scientific notation to regular numbers
9. Validate and clean zip codes
