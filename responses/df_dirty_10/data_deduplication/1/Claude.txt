I'll help you identify and remove duplicate records from this dataset. To do this effectively, we should:

1. First determine what constitutes a duplicate (same house listing)
2. Look for exact duplicates and near-duplicates based on key identifying features

Looking at the data, we can see some clear duplicates:

1. Rows 1 and 18 are exact duplicates (285 Center Ln, Fairfax, VA)
2. Rows 7 and 85 are duplicates (977 Adams Blvd, Westford)
3. Rows 29 and 44 are duplicates (same details in Tustin, CA)
4. Rows 39 and 57 are duplicates (88 East Ave, San Antonio, TX)
5. Rows 41 and 67 are duplicates (611 Hill Pl, Wichita, KS)
6. Rows 74 and 77 are duplicates (219 Field St, Prague, TX)
7. Rows 15 and 109 are duplicates (675 Circle Dr, Hulbert, OK)
8. Rows 12 and 102 are duplicates (655 First St, Stockbridge, MA)
9. Rows 24 and 76 are duplicates (380 Valley Ln, Fairborn, OH)
10. Rows 51 and 88 appear to be duplicates (668 Maple Ave, Saratoga Springs, UT)

To deduplicate the dataset, I would:

1. Keep the most recent/complete record when duplicates are found
2. Remove the duplicate entries

The deduplication criteria should be based on:
- Matching street addresses
- Matching cities
- Matching states
- Similar prices (accounting for minor variations)
- Similar property characteristics

Would you like me to provide the specific rows to keep and remove, or would you prefer the code to perform this deduplication automatically?
