I'll help you with data imputation for this dataset. Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, let's identify the columns and their data types:
- brokered_by: categorical/ID
- status: categorical
- price: numeric (with some formatting issues)
- bed: numeric
- bath: numeric
- acre_lot: numeric
- street: categorical
- city: categorical
- state: categorical
- zip_code: categorical
- house_size: numeric
- prev_sold_date: date

2. Let's identify the imputation strategy for each column:

a) Categorical columns:
- brokered_by: Replace NaN with "Unknown"
- status: Clean up variations ('s', 'f') and impute with mode
- street: Replace NaN with "Unknown"
- city: Replace NaN with "Unknown"
- state: Replace NaN with mode
- zip_code: Replace NaN with mode by state (if possible) or general mode

b) Numeric columns:
- price: 
  * Remove '$' and convert to numeric
  * Replace '-' with NaN
  * Impute with median
- bed: 
  * Replace 9999 with NaN
  * Replace '-' with NaN
  * Impute with median
- bath:
  * Replace '-' with NaN
  * Impute with median
- acre_lot:
  * Remove negative values (replace with NaN)
  * Impute with median
- house_size:
  * Convert scientific notation to regular numbers
  * Replace '-' with NaN
  * Impute with median

c) Date column:
- prev_sold_date:
  * Standardize date format
  * Impute with median date

3. Implementation order:
1. Clean data (remove special characters, standardize formats)
2. Handle obvious errors (9999, negative values)
3. Perform imputation

4. Special considerations:
- Some values might be correlated (price with house_size, bed with bath)
- Geographic considerations for price imputation
- Temporal aspects for price trends

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this imputation strategy?
