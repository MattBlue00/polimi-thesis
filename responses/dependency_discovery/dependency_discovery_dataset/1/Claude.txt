I'll help identify potential functional dependencies in this dataset. A functional dependency exists when one attribute (or a set of attributes) uniquely determines another attribute.

Looking at the data, here are some potential functional dependencies:

1. street, city, state → zip_code
   (The same street address in the same city and state should have the same zip code)

2. zip_code → city, state
   (A zip code typically determines a specific city and state)

3. brokered_by → (no clear dependencies)
   (Broker IDs appear to be unique but don't determine other attributes)

4. {street, city, state} → {price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size}
   (A specific address should determine the physical characteristics of the property at a given point in time)

However, there are some important caveats:

1. Some of these dependencies are temporal - prices and status can change over time
2. Some zip codes might span multiple cities
3. The same street name might appear in different parts of the same city
4. House characteristics (like size and number of rooms) could change due to renovations

To be more certain about these dependencies, we would need to:
1. Check for duplicate addresses
2. Verify if zip codes consistently map to the same city/state
3. Look for any anomalies in the data that might violate these dependencies

Would you like me to perform any specific checks on these potential dependencies?
