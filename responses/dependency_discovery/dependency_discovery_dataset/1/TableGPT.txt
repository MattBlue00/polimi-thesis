Yes, I can perform dependency discovery on the provided dataset. Dependency discovery is a process of identifying relationships between variables in a dataset. In this case, we will analyze the dataset to find any dependencies between the different columns.

Here's a brief summary of the dataset:

* `brokered_by`: Unique identifier for each property listing.
* `status`: The current status of the property (e.g., sold, for_sale).
* `price`: The price of the property.
* `bed`: Number of bedrooms in the property.
* `bath`: Number of bathrooms in the property.
* `acre_lot`: Size of the property in acres.
* `street`: Street address of the property.
* `city`: City where the property is located.
* `state`: State where the property is located.
* `zip_code`: Zip code of the property.
* `house_size`: Size of the house in square feet.
* `prev_sold_date`: Date when the property was previously sold (if applicable).

To perform dependency discovery, we can use various techniques such as correlation analysis, chi-square tests, or mutual information. However, since the dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables, we'll need to preprocess the data before applying these techniques.

Let's start by preprocessing the data and then proceed with the dependency discovery process.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Separate numerical and categorical features
numerical_features = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']
categorical_features = ['status', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'street']

# Preprocess numerical features
numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# Preprocess categorical features
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# Combine preprocessing steps
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ])

# Feature selection using ANOVA F-test
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=10)

# Create a pipeline combining preprocessor and feature selector
pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                           ('feature_selector', selector)])

# Apply the pipeline to the dataset
X = data.drop(columns=['brokered_by'])
X_preprocessed = pipeline.fit_transform(X)

# Print the selected features
selected_features = X.columns[pipeline.named_steps['feature_selector'].get_support()]
print("Selected features:", selected_features.tolist())
```

This code will preprocess the dataset, select the most important features using the ANOVA F-test, and print the selected features. Once we have the selected features, we can further analyze their relationships using techniques like correlation analysis or chi-square tests.
