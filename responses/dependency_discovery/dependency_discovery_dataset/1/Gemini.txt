Dependency discovery on this dataset can be approached in several ways, depending on what kind of dependencies you're looking for. Here's a breakdown of common approaches and how they might apply to this data:

**1. Functional Dependencies:**  These describe relationships where the value of one attribute determines the value of another.  In this dataset, functional dependencies are unlikely to be strict (meaning *always* true).  However, we might find approximate functional dependencies:

* **zip_code -> city, state:**  Zip codes often uniquely determine city and state.  There might be exceptions (e.g., a zip code shared across a city border), but this is a strong candidate.
* **house_size -> bed, bath:** Larger houses tend to have more bedrooms and bathrooms. This wouldn't be a strict dependency, but a general trend.
* **acre_lot -> price (weak):**  Larger lot sizes might correlate with higher prices, especially within the same city/area.  Many other factors influence price, so this would be a weak dependency.

**How to discover:**  You could use algorithms designed for functional dependency discovery.  Many of these are based on association rule mining or information theory.  You'd need to define a threshold for how often the dependency needs to hold to be considered valid.

**2. Correlational Dependencies:** These identify attributes that vary together.  They don't imply causation, just a statistical relationship.

* **price, house_size:**  Likely a positive correlation.
* **price, bed, bath:**  Also likely positive correlations.
* **price, acre_lot:**  As mentioned above, a potential positive correlation, but likely weaker than the others.

**How to discover:** Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between numerical attributes.  Visualizations like scatter plots can also be helpful.

**3. Conditional Dependencies:** These describe relationships that hold true only under certain conditions.

* **Given city = "Stockbridge", price might be strongly correlated with house_size.**  In a different city, the relationship might be different.
* **Given state = "California", acre_lot might have a stronger influence on price than in states with lower land values.**

**How to discover:**  Techniques like decision tree learning or subgroup discovery can help identify conditional dependencies.

**4. Temporal Dependencies:** These involve relationships that change over time.

* **price might increase over time due to inflation or market trends.**  Analyzing `prev_sold_date` and `price` could reveal such trends.

**How to discover:** Time series analysis techniques are relevant here.

**Tools and Libraries (Python):**

* **Functional Dependencies:**  `pyfd` library.
* **Correlational Dependencies:**  `pandas` (`.corr()`), `scipy.stats`, `seaborn` (for visualization).
* **Conditional Dependencies:**  `scikit-learn` (decision trees, other machine learning models).
* **Temporal Dependencies:**  `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`.


**Example using pandas for correlation:**

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")  # Replace with your file name
df['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['prev_sold_date']) # Convert to datetime

# Calculate correlations (excluding non-numeric columns)
numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
correlations = numeric_df.corr()
print(correlations)

# Example scatter plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(df['house_size'], df['price'])
plt.xlabel('House Size')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```

Remember to choose the appropriate method based on the type of dependency you're interested in and the characteristics of your data.  The example above is just a starting point. You'll likely need to explore multiple approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dependencies in your dataset.
