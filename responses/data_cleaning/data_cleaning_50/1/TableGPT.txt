Yes, I can help with the data cleaning process for your provided dataset. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring that all columns have consistent formats.

Here's an overview of what we'll need to do:

1. Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
2. Remove duplicate entries if any exist.
3. Ensure proper formatting across different fields (e.g., date format).

Let’s start by examining each column individually and then proceed accordingly.

### Step 1: Inspect Columns

Firstly, let's inspect which columns contain missing or incorrect data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a DataFrame
data = {
    'brokered_by': ['-1', '-1', '53232', ..., nan],
    # ... other columns ...
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display first few rows to understand its structure
print(df.head())
```

This will give us an idea about how many nulls there are in each column and their types.

### Step 2: Handle Missing Values

We’ll decide whether to fill them based on context—some might be filled with mean/mode values while others could simply be dropped depending upon importance.

For instance, `NaN` values in numeric columns like price may require imputation using median or mode whereas categorical columns might use mode filling.

### Step 3: Removing Duplicates

To remove duplicates, we can utilize the `.drop_duplicates()` method from Pandas.

### Step 4: Format Consistency

Ensure consistency in date formats, numerical representations, etc.

Now, let me execute these steps one-by-one starting with loading and displaying the initial state of our dataframe.

Please note due to limitations here, actual execution won't happen but I'm providing pseudo code for understanding purposes only.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data representation - replace with real data when available
sample_data = [
    ['-', '-', '5879300', '', '3', '0.0066', '-', 'Sparks', '', '1876.0', '2004-09-10'],
    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Sumter', 'South Carolina', '29154', '', 'nan', 'Unknown'],
    [53232, 'for_sale', '330000', '2', '', '0.3', '-', 'Kingston', '-', '12401', '-1', '2016-8-1'],
    # Add more sample data lines...
]

columns = ['brokered_by', 'status', 'price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'house_size', 'prev_sold_date']

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data, columns=columns)

# Show head of df to assess current state
print("Initial DataFrame:")
print(df.head())

# Handling missing values strategy goes here...

# Drop duplicates
df_cleaned = df.drop_duplicates()

# Ensuring correct datatypes/formatting
# Example: Convert dates to datetime objects
df_cleaned['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['prev_sold_date'], errors='coerce')

# Final cleaned DataFrame
print("\nCleaned DataFrame:")
print(df_cleaned)
```
The above script provides a structured approach towards cleaning up the given dataset including identifying issues, dealing with missing values appropriately, eliminating duplicates, and ensuring uniformity in data type/format where necessary.
