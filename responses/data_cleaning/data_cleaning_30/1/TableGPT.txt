Yes, I can help with the data cleaning process for your provided dataset. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring that all columns have consistent formatting.

Here's an overview of what we'll need to do:

1. Handle missing values: We will replace or remove rows/columns where necessary.
2. Remove duplicate entries if any exist.
3. Ensure proper column names and formats (remove leading/trailing spaces).
4. Convert price strings into numeric format when possible.
5. Standardize date formats across the entire dataset.

Letâ€™s start by loading the data and inspecting its structure before proceeding with these steps.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')

# Display basic information about the dataframe
print(data.info())
print(data.head(10))
```

Please upload the file so I can proceed with the actual cleaning tasks. If there is no specific path mentioned in the code above, please provide me with the exact location of the file.
