Yes, I can help with the data cleaning process for your provided dataset. Here's an outline of what we'll need to address:

1. Handle missing values.
2. Correct inconsistent or incorrect entries (such as invalid dates).
3. Standardize formatting and units.

Let's start by loading the data into Python using pandas library and then proceed step-by-step through each issue identified in the dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')

# Display first few rows of the dataframe to understand its structure
print(data.head())

# Check for any missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

# Convert 'date' columns to datetime format if necessary
data['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['prev_sold_date'], errors='coerce')
data['prev_sold_date'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill method to replace NaNs

# Remove unnecessary characters ('$','-', etc.) from price column before converting to float type
def clean_price(price):
    return float(str(price).replace('$', '').replace(',', ''))

data['price'] = data['price'].apply(clean_price)
```

This is just the beginning of our data cleaning journey. We still have other issues like handling non-standardized addresses, standardizing house sizes, dealing with negative acreage/lotsizes, among others. Let me know which specific areas you'd like to focus on next!
