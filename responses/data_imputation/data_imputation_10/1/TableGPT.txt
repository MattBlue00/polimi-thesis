Yes, I can help with data imputation for the given dataset using Python and pandas library.

Firstly, let's load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Load the dataset from CSV file (assuming it is named 'data.csv')
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display first few rows of the dataframe to understand its structure
print(df.head())
```

Now that we have loaded the dataset, let's perform some basic preprocessing steps before applying any imputation techniques:

1. Convert categorical columns like `status` to numerical values.
2. Handle missing values in non-numerical columns if necessary.
3. Apply appropriate imputation methods based on column types.

Here’s how you might handle these tasks step-by-step:

### Step 1: Preprocessing Categorical Columns

Convert categorical variables such as `status`, which has string labels (`sold`, `Unknown`, etc.), into numeric format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

```python
# One-hot encode status column
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df['status'], prefix='status', drop_first=True)

# Drop original status column
df.drop(columns=['status'], inplace=True)

# Concatenate encoded status back to df
df = pd.concat([df, df_encoded], axis=1)
```

### Step 2: Handling Missing Values in Non-Numerical Columns

If there are other non-numerical columns with missing values, they need special handling depending on their content. For instance, street names could be filled with common placeholders or dropped entirely if not useful.

For now, let's focus on numerical columns where most imputations will apply.

### Step 3: Imputation Techniques

We'll use mean/median imputation for numerical columns and mode-based imputation for categorical ones. Here’s an example implementation:

```python
# Define separate imputers for numerical and categorical columns
num_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean') # Use median strategy instead?
cat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent') 

# Separate numerical and categorical features
numerical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()
categorical_cols = df.select_dtypes(exclude=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

# Fit and transform numerical columns
df[numerical_cols] = num_imputer.fit_transform(df[numerical_cols])

# Fit and transform categorical columns
df[categorical_cols] = cat_imputer.fit_transform(df[categorical_cols])
```

This code snippet performs simple imputation but may require adjustments based on specific requirements regarding what constitutes acceptable imputed values and whether certain columns should undergo different treatments due to domain knowledge about them.

Finally, save your cleaned-up DataFrame back to disk after checking for consistency across all operations performed so far:

```python
# Save the preprocessed dataframe to a new csv file
df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```

Remember, while this provides a starting point, real-world datasets often necessitate more sophisticated approaches including advanced imputation strategies tailored specifically towards each feature set within the context provided by business logic or statistical analysis results. Always validate post-imputation assumptions against actual distribution patterns observed in raw data samples whenever possible!
