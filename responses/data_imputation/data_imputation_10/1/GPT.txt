Data imputation involves filling in missing values in a dataset. Here are some common strategies for handling missing data:

1. **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: For numerical columns, you can fill missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column. For categorical columns, you can use the mode.

2. **Forward/Backward Fill**: This method fills missing values using the previous or next value in the column. It's useful for time series data.

3. **Interpolation**: This method estimates missing values based on other available data points. It's often used for time series data.

4. **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning models to predict missing values based on other features in the dataset.

5. **Domain-Specific Imputation**: Use domain knowledge to fill in missing values. For example, if a house's number of bedrooms is missing, you might use the average number of bedrooms for similar houses in the same area.

Let's apply some of these strategies to your dataset:

### Numerical Columns

- **Price, Bed, Bath, Acre Lot, House Size**: Use median imputation for these columns, as they are likely to have skewed distributions.

### Categorical Columns

- **Brokered By, Status, Street, City, State, Zip Code, Prev Sold Date**: Use mode imputation for these columns, as they are categorical.

### Imputation Example

Here's how you might perform imputation on this dataset using Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Fill missing numerical values with the median
numerical_cols = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']
for col in numerical_cols:
    data[col] = data[col].replace(-1, np.nan)  # Replace -1 with NaN if used as a placeholder
    data[col].fillna(data[col].median(), inplace=True)

# Fill missing categorical values with the mode
categorical_cols = ['brokered_by', 'status', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'prev_sold_date']
for col in categorical_cols:
    data[col].fillna(data[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Display the imputed dataset
print(data)
```

### Notes

- **Custom Imputation**: You might want to apply custom logic for certain columns. For example, if a house's `zip_code` is missing but the `city` and `state` are known, you could infer the `zip_code` from other entries with the same `city` and `state`.

- **Outliers**: Be cautious of outliers when using mean imputation, as they can skew the results. Median is often more robust.

- **Domain Knowledge**: Use domain knowledge to guide imputation decisions, especially for critical fields like `price` or `bed`.

- **Validation**: After imputation, validate the dataset to ensure that the imputed values make sense in the context of the data.
