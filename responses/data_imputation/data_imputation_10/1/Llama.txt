Data imputation is the process of replacing missing values in a dataset with estimated values. There are several methods for imputing missing data, including:

1. Mean/Median Imputation: Replacing missing values with the mean or median of the respective feature.
2. Regression Imputation: Using a regression model to predict the missing values based on other features.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Finding the k most similar samples to the sample with missing values and using their values to impute the missing values.
4. Random Forest Imputation: Using a random forest model to predict the missing values based on other features.
5. MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) Imputation: Using a series of regression models to impute missing values, with each model using the imputed values from the previous model.

I will use the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries in Python to perform data imputation on your dataset.

First, let's load the dataset:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
```
Next, let's identify the missing values in the dataset:
```python
# Identify missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```
This will give us a count of the missing values in each column.

Now, let's perform mean imputation on the missing values:
```python
# Mean imputation
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
```
This will replace the missing values with the mean of the respective feature.

Alternatively, we can use regression imputation:
```python
# Regression imputation
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Create a random forest regressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model to the data
rf.fit(df.dropna(), df.dropna())

# Impute missing values
df.fillna(rf.predict(df.dropna()), inplace=True)
```
This will use a random forest regressor to predict the missing values based on the other features.

We can also use KNN imputation:
```python
# KNN imputation
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

# Create a KNN regressor
knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5, weights='uniform')

# Fit the model to the data
knn.fit(df.dropna(), df.dropna())

# Impute missing values
df.fillna(knn.predict(df.dropna()), inplace=True)
```
This will find the k most similar samples to the sample with missing values and use their values to impute the missing values.

Finally, we can use MICE imputation:
```python
# MICE imputation
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Create a simple imputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

# Fit the imputer to the data
imputer.fit(df.dropna())

# Impute missing values
df.fillna(imputer.transform(df.dropna()), inplace=True)
```
This will use a series of regression models to impute missing values, with each model using the imputed values from the previous model.

Note that the choice of imputation method depends on the nature of the missing data and the characteristics of the dataset. It's always a good idea to evaluate the imputation method using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE) to ensure that the imputed values are reasonable.
