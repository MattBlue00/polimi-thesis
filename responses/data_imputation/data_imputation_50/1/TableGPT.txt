Yes, I can help with data imputation for the provided dataset. Data imputation is the process of replacing missing values in a dataset with estimated values. There are several strategies for imputing missing data, including mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation.

Here's an example of how to perform mean imputation using Python and the pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Replace non-numeric values with NaN
data.replace('-', np.nan, inplace=True)

# Impute missing values with the mean of each column
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

# If you want to impute with specific values based on the data type of each column
# For numeric columns
data['numeric_column'].fillna(data['numeric_column'].mean(), inplace=True)
# For categorical columns
data['categorical_column'].fillna(data['categorical_column'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

Please note that you need to replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the path to your actual dataset file, and 'numeric_column' and 'categorical_column' with the names of your actual numeric and categorical columns, respectively.

Keep in mind that mean imputation might not always be the best strategy, especially if the data has outliers or if the missing values have a specific pattern. Other imputation methods, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation or multiple imputation, might be more appropriate in some cases.
