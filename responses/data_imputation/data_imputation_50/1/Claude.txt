I can help you with data imputation for this dataset. There are several approaches we could take:

1. For numerical columns (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size):
- Replace -1 with NaN first
- Use median imputation for missing values
- Handle outliers if necessary

2. For categorical columns (brokered_by, status, street, city, state):
- Replace '-' with NaN
- Use mode imputation (most frequent value)
- For location-based fields, we could potentially use nearby locations

3. For dates (prev_sold_date):
- Replace 'Unknown' with NaN
- Use median date or forward/backward fill

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these imputation strategies? Also, do you have any specific requirements or preferences for the imputation methods to use?

I can write the code to:
1. Clean the data (replace -1, '-', 'Unknown', etc. with NaN)
2. Perform the imputation
3. Show you the results with before/after statistics

Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
