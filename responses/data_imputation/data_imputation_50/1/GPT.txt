Data imputation involves filling in missing or incomplete data in a dataset. Given the dataset you provided, we can apply several strategies to handle missing values. Here are some common imputation techniques:

1. **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: For numerical columns, you can fill missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column. For categorical columns, you can use the mode.

2. **Forward/Backward Fill**: This method fills missing values using the previous or next value in the column. It is useful for time-series data.

3. **Constant Value Imputation**: Fill missing values with a constant value, such as 0 or "Unknown".

4. **Predictive Imputation**: Use machine learning models to predict and fill missing values based on other features.

5. **Dropping Missing Values**: In some cases, it might be appropriate to drop rows or columns with a high percentage of missing values.

Let's apply some of these techniques to your dataset:

### Imputation Steps:

1. **Numerical Columns**:
   - For `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size`, we can use the median to fill missing values, as it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

2. **Categorical Columns**:
   - For `brokered_by`, `status`, `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code`, we can fill missing values with "Unknown" or the mode of the column.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - For `prev_sold_date`, if the date is missing, it might be reasonable to leave it as missing or fill it with a placeholder like "Unknown" if the exact date is not critical.

Here's how you might implement these steps in Python using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Fill numerical columns with median
numerical_cols = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']
for col in numerical_cols:
    data[col] = data[col].fillna(data[col].median())

# Fill categorical columns with 'Unknown' or mode
categorical_cols = ['brokered_by', 'status', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code']
for col in categorical_cols:
    data[col] = data[col].fillna('Unknown')

# Fill 'prev_sold_date' with 'Unknown'
data['prev_sold_date'] = data['prev_sold_date'].fillna('Unknown')

# Display the imputed dataset
print(data.head())
```

This code snippet provides a basic approach to data imputation. Depending on the specific requirements and context of your analysis, you might choose different imputation strategies or refine these methods further.
