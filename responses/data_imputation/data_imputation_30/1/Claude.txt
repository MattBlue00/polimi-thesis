I can help you with data imputation for this dataset. There are several approaches we can take, depending on the type of data and the nature of missing values. Here's a suggested approach:

1. For numerical columns (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size):
- Replace -1 with NaN first
- Use median imputation for these values
- For house prices, we might want to consider using a regression model based on other features

2. For categorical columns (brokered_by, status, street, city, state):
- Replace '-' and 'Unknown' with NaN
- Use mode imputation (most frequent value)

3. For date columns (prev_sold_date):
- Replace 'Unknown' with NaN
- Use median date

4. For zip_code:
- Replace -1 with NaN
- Could be imputed based on city/state combinations where possible
- Otherwise use mode imputation

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this imputation strategy? I can provide the Python code using pandas and scikit-learn to perform these operations.

Also, before proceeding, I should mention that some columns might benefit from more sophisticated imputation methods like:
- KNN imputation
- Iterative imputation (MICE)
- Using relationships between variables (e.g., using city to predict zip code)

Which approach would you prefer to see implemented?
