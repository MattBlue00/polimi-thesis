Data standardization, also known as Z-score normalization, rescales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  It's important to only standardize numerical features.  Here's how we can approach this with the provided dataset, along with explanations and considerations:

**1. Identify Numerical Features:**

The numerical features in this dataset are: `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `zip_code`, `house_size`.  Note:  `bed` and `bath` are often treated as categorical despite being represented with numbers/words. We'll treat them numerically here, but that might not always be the best approach.

**2. Handle Data Type Issues:**

* **`price`:** Contains '$' and commas. Needs cleaning to convert to numeric.
* **`bed` and `bath`:**  Contain string representations of numbers ("one", "two", "three").  Need conversion to numeric.
* **`prev_sold_date`:** This is a date and shouldn't be standardized.  We might calculate days since sale for standardization if needed for a specific analysis.

**3. Standardization Process:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data (assuming it's in a CSV file named 'housing_data.csv')
df = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

# Data Cleaning and Conversion
df['price'] = df['price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)
number_mapping = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6}
df['bed'] = df['bed'].replace(number_mapping).astype(float)
df['bath'] = df['bath'].replace(number_mapping).astype(float)


# Select numerical columns (excluding zip_code as it's categorical)
numerical_cols = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']

# Standardize selected columns
for col in numerical_cols:
    df[col] = (df[col] - df[col].mean()) / df[col].std()

print(df[numerical_cols].head())
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary libraries:** `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` for numerical operations.
2. **Load data:**  Reads the data from a CSV file.  Adjust the filename if necessary.
3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - `price`: Removes '$' and commas, then converts to float.
   - `bed`, `bath`: Replaces string representations with numerical equivalents.
4. **Column Selection:** Selects the numerical columns for standardization.  `zip_code` is excluded as it's a categorical variable, even though it's numeric.
5. **Standardization:**  Iterates through the selected columns, calculating the Z-score for each value and replacing the original value with the standardized value.  The formula `(x - mean) / std` is applied.

**Key Considerations:**

* **`zip_code`:**  Zip codes are categorical.  Standardizing them doesn't make sense.  One-hot encoding or other categorical encoding methods would be more appropriate.
* **`bed` and `bath`:** Treating these as numerical might be okay for some analyses (e.g., regression), but consider their ordinal nature.  Alternatives include ordinal encoding.
* **Outliers:** Standardization can be affected by outliers.  Consider outlier handling before standardization if necessary.
* **Scikit-learn:**  For more complex standardization needs (e.g., fitting on a training set and applying to a test set), use `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.


This revised approach provides a more robust and accurate standardization of the numerical data in your dataset, taking into account data cleaning and the categorical nature of certain fields. Remember to adapt the code to your specific needs and consider the nature of your data when choosing standardization or other preprocessing techniques.
