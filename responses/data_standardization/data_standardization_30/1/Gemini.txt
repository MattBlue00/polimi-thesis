Data standardization typically refers to transforming numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  This is also known as Z-score normalization.  Here's how we can approach this with the provided dataset, along with considerations for the data:

**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

* **`price`:** Remove '$' and commas, then convert to numeric.
* **`bed` and `bath`:**  These are categorical, represented numerically.  One-hot encoding would be more appropriate than standardization.  However, values like "two", "three", "four", and "five" suggest an ordinal relationship.  We could convert them to numerical representations (2, 3, 4, 5) and *then* standardize, or treat them as ordinal categories.
* **`acre_lot`:** Convert to numeric.
* **`house_size`:**  This seems to be numerical already.
* **`prev_sold_date`:** This is a date. Standardization doesn't make sense for dates.  Feature engineering (e.g., days since sold, year sold) would be more useful.
* **Other columns:** `brokered_by`, `status`, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code` are categorical and not suitable for standardization.  One-hot encoding or other categorical encoding methods would be appropriate.

**2. Standardization (Z-score Normalization):**

For each numerical feature we want to standardize (e.g., `price`, `acre_lot`, `house_size` after cleaning), we apply the following formula:

```
z = (x - μ) / σ
```

where:
* `z` is the standardized value
* `x` is the original value
* `μ` is the mean of the feature
* `σ` is the standard deviation of the feature

**Python Code Example (using pandas and scikit-learn):**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Load the data (assuming it's in a CSV file named 'real_estate.csv')
df = pd.read_csv("real_estate.csv")

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
df['price'] = df['price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)

number_words = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six':6}
df['bed'] = df['bed'].replace(number_words).astype(float)
df['bath'] = df['bath'].replace(number_words).astype(float)


# Select numerical features for standardization
numerical_features = ['price', 'acre_lot', 'house_size', 'bed', 'bath']  # Include bed and bath if treating as numerical
df_numerical = df[numerical_features].dropna() # Drop rows with missing values in numerical columns

# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit and transform the numerical data
df_standardized = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df_numerical), columns=numerical_features)

# Concatenate standardized numerical features with the rest of the dataframe
df_final = pd.concat([df.drop(numerical_features, axis=1), df_standardized], axis=1)

print(df_final.head())
```

**Key Points:**

* **Missing Values:** The code includes `.dropna()` to handle missing values in the numerical columns.  A more sophisticated approach might be imputation.
* **Categorical Features:**  Remember that standardization is not applied to the categorical features. You'll need to use appropriate encoding methods for them.
* **`bed` and `bath`:** The code treats `bed` and `bath` as numerical after converting them.  Consider whether ordinal encoding or one-hot encoding is more appropriate for your specific analysis.
* **`prev_sold_date`:**  The code does *not* process the date.  You'll need to engineer relevant features from it.

This revised approach provides a more complete solution, addressing data cleaning, numerical conversion, and standardization, while also highlighting important considerations for handling different data types. Remember to adapt the code and feature engineering steps to your specific analytical goals.
