Certainly! Data standardization involves converting the dataset into a standard format, which typically includes ensuring all numerical columns are in a consistent numeric format and handling missing or non-standard data. Hereâ€™s how we can standardize the given dataset:

### Original Dataset
```
[TAB] brokered_by | status | price | bed | bath | acre_lot | street | city | state | zip_code | house_size | prev_sold_date [SEP] 94681 | sold | 409900 | 2 | one | 2.12 | 655 First St | Stockbridge | Massachusetts | 1262 | 1015 | 2021-11-29 [SEP] ... (and so on)
```

### Standardized Dataset
```
[TAB] brokered_by | status | price | bed | bath | acre_lot | street | city | state | zip_code | house_size | prev_sold_date [SEP] 94681 | sold | 409900 | 2 | 1 | 2.12 | 655 First St | Stockbridge | Massachusetts | 1262 | 1015 | 2021-11-29 [SEP] ... (and so on)
```

### Steps Taken:
1. **Handle Non-Numeric Columns**: Convert non-numeric values (like 'one' for 'bath') to their numeric equivalents.
2. **Consistent Numeric Format**: Ensure all numeric columns are in a consistent numeric format.

By following these steps, the dataset becomes more uniform and easier to process for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
