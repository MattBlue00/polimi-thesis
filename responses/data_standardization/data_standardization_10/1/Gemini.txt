Data standardization typically refers to transforming numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is also known as Z-score normalization.  Here's how we can approach this using Python and the pandas library, along with explanations of the necessary data cleaning steps:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data (assuming it's in a CSV file named 'real_estate.csv')
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('real_estate.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Sample data provided in the prompt (create a DataFrame)
    data = { # ... (your data from the prompt) }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

# 1. Price: Remove '$' and convert to numeric
df['price'] = df['price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True)
df['price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['price'], errors='coerce')  # 'coerce' handles non-numeric values

# 2. Bed and Bath: Convert string representations to numeric
mapping = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'six':6}
df['bed'] = df['bed'].replace(mapping).astype('float')
df['bath'] = df['bath'].replace(mapping).astype('float')


# 3. House Size: Correct units (assumed to be in square feet, not fractions)
df['house_size'] = df['house_size'] * 1000000
df['house_size'] = df['house_size'].astype('float')

# 4. Dates: Convert to datetime objects
df['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['prev_sold_date'], errors='coerce')

# 5. State: Handle abbreviations (optional, but good practice)
# Create a dictionary to map state abbreviations to full names if needed.
# Example: us_state_to_abbrev = { ... }
# df['state'] = df['state'].map(us_state_to_abbrev).fillna(df['state'])


# Standardization (Z-score Normalization)

# Select numerical columns for standardization (excluding zip_code, which is categorical)
numerical_cols = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']

# Calculate mean and standard deviation for each column
for col in numerical_cols:
    mean = df[col].mean()
    std = df[col].std()
    
    # Standardize the column (handle potential division by zero)
    if std != 0:  # Avoid division by zero if a column has zero variance
        df[col] = (df[col] - mean) / std
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Column '{col}' has zero standard deviation. Not standardizing.")
        # You might consider removing such columns as they don't provide much information.


# Print the standardized data (or save to a new CSV)
print(df.head())
# df.to_csv('standardized_real_estate.csv', index=False)

```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:** The code now includes `errors='coerce'` in `pd.to_numeric` and `pd.to_datetime` to handle invalid data entries gracefully.  Non-numeric values will be converted to `NaN` (Not a Number).
* **House Size Correction:** The assumption is made that `house_size` is in square feet and was incorrectly represented as fractions. The code multiplies by 1,000,000 to correct this.  Adjust this factor if your data has a different scale.
* **State Abbreviation Handling (Optional):**  The code includes a commented-out section to handle state abbreviations. You'll need to create a dictionary mapping abbreviations to full names if you want to use this.
* **Zero Variance Handling:** The code now checks for columns with zero standard deviation (which can cause division by zero errors). It prints a warning and skips standardization for such columns.
* **Clearer Comments:**  More comments have been added to explain each step.


This improved code addresses the data cleaning needs and performs standardization robustly, handling potential issues in the data. Remember to install the pandas library (`pip install pandas`).
