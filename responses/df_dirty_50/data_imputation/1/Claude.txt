I can help with data imputation. Given the dataset's complexity and mixed data types, we should handle the imputation carefully. Here's an approach we could take:

1. For numerical columns (price, acre_lot, house_size):
- Replace missing values with median/mean
- Handle any negative values that don't make sense
- Convert price strings to numerical values

2. For categorical columns (status, city, state):
- Replace missing values with mode
- Standardize formats (e.g., state abbreviations)

3. For binary/discrete columns (bed, bath):
- Replace missing values with median
- Handle outliers (like 9999)

4. For dates:
- Standardize format
- Replace missing values with median date

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this imputation strategy? I can break it down into steps and show you the code and results for each part.

Also, I notice some specific patterns that need attention:
- '-' values that should be treated as NaN
- Mixed formats in the price column ($xxx,xxx vs numeric)
- Extreme values in bed column (9999)
- Inconsistent state formats (full names vs abbreviations)

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect first?
