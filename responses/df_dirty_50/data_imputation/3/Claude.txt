I'll help you analyze and suggest data imputation strategies for this dataset. Let's break it down by column:

1. brokered_by: Contains agent names and numeric IDs. Missing values could be:
- For numeric IDs: impute with median
- For names: cannot reliably impute, better to keep as missing

2. status: Categorical variable with values like 'sold', 'for_sale', 'f', 's'. Could:
- Replace 'f' with 'for_sale' and 's' with 'sold'
- Impute missing with mode

3. price: Numeric with some values having '$' symbol. Should:
- Remove '$' and convert to numeric
- Impute missing values with median
- Handle outliers if needed

4. bed: Many '9999' values which are clearly errors. Should:
- Replace 9999 with NaN
- Impute with median of valid values

5. bath: Contains missing values and '-'. Should:
- Replace '-' with NaN
- Impute with median

6. acre_lot: Contains negative values which are invalid. Should:
- Replace negative values with NaN
- Impute with median

7. street, city, state: Address fields
- Not recommended to impute missing values
- Could standardize existing values

8. zip_code: Numeric postal codes
- Keep as is, don't impute missing values
- Could validate format

9. house_size: Contains scientific notation and missing values
- Convert to standard numeric format
- Impute missing with median

10. prev_sold_date: Different date formats
- Standardize date format
- Don't impute missing dates

Implementation steps would be:
1. Clean data (remove special characters, standardize formats)
2. Convert datatypes appropriately
3. Handle obvious errors (like 9999 in beds)
4. Perform imputation

Would you like me to provide the specific code for any of these steps?
