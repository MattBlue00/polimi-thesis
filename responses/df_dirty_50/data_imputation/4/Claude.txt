I'll help you with data imputation for this dataset. Let's break it down into steps:

1. First, let's analyze the types of missing values:
- Missing values are represented as NaN, '-', and empty strings
- Some numeric columns have string values with '$' symbols
- Some date columns have different formats

2. Let's identify the columns and their appropriate data types:
- brokered_by: categorical
- status: categorical
- price: numeric
- bed: numeric
- bath: numeric
- acre_lot: numeric
- street: categorical
- city: categorical
- state: categorical
- zip_code: categorical
- house_size: numeric
- prev_sold_date: date

3. Key observations for imputation:
- Some numeric values like '9999' in 'bed' column appear to be invalid entries
- Price values need to be cleaned of '$' and converted to numeric
- There are duplicate entries (e.g., same address with different prices)
- Some columns have clear patterns that could help with imputation

4. Recommended imputation strategies:
- Numerical columns (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size):
  * Use median for central tendency
  * Remove obvious invalid values (like 9999)
  * Convert all values to proper numeric format

- Categorical columns (brokered_by, status, street, city, state, zip_code):
  * Use mode (most frequent value)
  * For broker names, might want to standardize format

- Dates:
  * Convert all to consistent format
  * Use median date for missing values

5. Special considerations:
- Some columns might be better left with missing values if imputation would introduce too much bias
- Related columns could be used for more accurate imputation (e.g., city-state-zip relationships)
- Some rows might be better dropped if they have too many missing values

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this imputation strategy?
