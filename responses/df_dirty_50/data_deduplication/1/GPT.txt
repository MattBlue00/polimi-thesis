Data deduplication involves identifying and removing duplicate records from a dataset. In this dataset, we can identify duplicates by comparing all columns for identical values. However, given the nature of real estate data, some columns might not be reliable for deduplication due to missing or inconsistent data. Therefore, we should focus on key columns that are more likely to uniquely identify a property listing, such as `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, and `price`.

Here's a step-by-step approach to deduplicate the dataset:

1. **Identify Key Columns**: Choose columns that are most likely to uniquely identify a property. In this case, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, and `price` are good candidates.

2. **Handle Missing Values**: Decide how to handle rows with missing values in key columns. You might choose to drop these rows or fill them with placeholder values if they are critical for deduplication.

3. **Remove Duplicates**: Use the identified key columns to find and remove duplicate rows.

Here's a Python code snippet using pandas to perform deduplication:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming `df` is your DataFrame
# Fill missing values in key columns with a placeholder if necessary
df['street'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
df['city'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
df['state'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
df['zip_code'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
df['price'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)

# Deduplicate based on key columns
deduplicated_df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['street', 'city', 'state', 'zip_code', 'price'])

# Display the deduplicated DataFrame
print(deduplicated_df)
```

This code will remove duplicate rows based on the combination of `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, and `price`. Adjust the columns used for deduplication based on your specific needs and the quality of the data in each column.
