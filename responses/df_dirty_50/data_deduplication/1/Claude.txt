I'll help you identify and remove duplicate records from this dataset. To do this effectively, we should:

1. First determine what constitutes a duplicate (as there might be slight variations in values but still represent the same property)
2. Look for exact duplicates and near-duplicates based on key identifying features

Here are some examples of duplicates I can identify from your dataset:

1. Rows 1 and 10 appear to be duplicates (same address "47 Lincoln Road" and similar price)
2. Rows 2 and 11 are duplicates (same price $278900 and other matching features)
3. Rows 19 and 41 are exact duplicates (same broker "William Davis", address "400 Adams Ct")
4. Rows 23 and 13 are duplicates (same broker ID 65293 and other matching features)
5. Rows 25 and 14 are duplicates (same address "82 Lincoln Ave" and price 440000)
6. Rows 26 and 44 are duplicates (same address "285 Center Lane" and similar features)
7. Rows 35 and 45 are duplicates (same broker ID 78139 and other matching features)
8. Rows 46 and 56 are duplicates (same broker ID 2177 and address "842 Cedar Dr")
9. Rows 49 and 53 are duplicates (same broker ID 94681 and address "655 First Street")
10. Rows 70 and 71 are duplicates (same address "272 Broadway Ln" and broker "Charles Swift")
11. Rows 74 and 76 are duplicates (same address "603 Princess St" and price 509900)
12. Rows 73 and 77 are duplicates (same broker "Julia Rodriguez" and other matching features)
13. Rows 142 and 125 are duplicates (same broker "James Carpenter" and address "223 Lake Street")

To clean this dataset, you should:
1. Keep only one instance of each duplicate pair
2. Choose the row with more complete information when possible
3. If the information is conflicting between duplicates, you might want to verify which values are correct before removing either record

Would you like me to help you create a cleaned version of this dataset with duplicates removed?
