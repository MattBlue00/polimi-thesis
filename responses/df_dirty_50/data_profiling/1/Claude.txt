I'll help you profile this dataset. Here's a high-level analysis:

1. Dataset Dimensions:
- Rows: 150 (0-149)
- Columns: 11

2. Column Types and Content:
- brokered_by: Mixed (strings, numbers, and nulls)
- status: Categorical (sold, for_sale, 's', 'f', nulls)
- price: Mixed (numeric and currency format with '$' symbol)
- bed: Mixed (numeric, '9999' appears frequently)
- bath: Numeric with nulls
- acre_lot: Numeric with negative values
- street: String addresses with nulls
- city: String with nulls
- state: String (US state names and abbreviations)
- zip_code: Mixed (numeric postal codes)
- house_size: Mixed (numeric and scientific notation)
- prev_sold_date: Date in multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD and MM/DD/YY)

3. Data Quality Issues:
- Missing values represented as '-', 'NaN', and empty cells
- Inconsistent date formats
- Mixed data types in several columns
- Possible placeholder values (9999 in bed column)
- Negative values in acre_lot (which shouldn't be possible)
- Inconsistent price formatting ($symbol vs no symbol)
- Multiple formats for status indicators

4. Notable Patterns:
- Many properties have 9999 bedrooms (likely a placeholder/error code)
- Some duplicate entries with slight variations
- State information is sometimes abbreviated, sometimes full name
- Price values range from very low (thousands) to millions

5. Recommendations for Cleaning:
- Standardize missing value representation
- Convert price to numeric by removing '$' and standardizing format
- Standardize date format
- Clean up status codes to consistent values
- Remove or investigate negative acre_lot values
- Standardize state names to either full names or abbreviations
- Convert house_size to standard numeric format
