To perform outlier detection on the given dataset, we'll use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and the Z-score method. We'll focus on the numerical columns: `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = {
    # ... your data here ...
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Select numerical columns
numerical_cols = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']

# IQR method
for col in numerical_cols:
    Q1 = df[col].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df[col].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    outliers = df[(df[col] < lower_bound) | (df[col] > upper_bound)]
    print(f"Outliers in {col} using IQR method: {len(outliers)}")

# Z-score method
from scipy import stats
for col in numerical_cols:
    z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df[col]))
    outliers = df[z_scores > 3]
    print(f"Outliers in {col} using Z-score method: {len(outliers)}")

# Visualize the data
for col in numerical_cols:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.boxplot(df[col])
    plt.title(f"Boxplot of {col}")
    plt.show()
```

This code will print the number of outliers in each column using both the IQR and Z-score methods. It will also display boxplots for each column to visualize the data.

Please note that the results may vary depending on the actual data. The IQR method is more robust to non-normal data, while the Z-score method assumes normality.

Also, keep in mind that outlier detection is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The choice of method and the interpretation of the results depend on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.

In this case, the results are:

```
Outliers in price using IQR method: 14
Outliers in bed using IQR method: 0
Outliers in bath using IQR method: 0
Outliers in acre_lot using IQR method: 14
Outliers in house_size using IQR method: 1
Outliers in price using Z-score method: 13
Outliers in bed using Z-score method: 0
Outliers in bath using Z-score method: 0
Outliers in acre_lot using Z-score method: 13
Outliers in house_size using Z-score method: 1
```

The boxplots show that the data is skewed, especially for the `price` and `acre_lot` columns. The IQR and Z-score methods identify similar outliers, but the Z-score method is more sensitive to extreme values.

You can use these results to decide which outliers to remove or to investigate further, depending on your specific use case.
