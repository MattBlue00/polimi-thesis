Yes, I can perform outlier detection on the given dataset. To identify outliers, we can use statistical methods such as the Z-score or the Modified Z-score, which measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Another method is the Interquartile Range (IQR), which identifies outliers based on the difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).

Here's a Python code snippet using the IQR method:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = [
    # ... (dataset values)
]

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["brokered_by", "status", "price", "bed", "bath", "acre_lot", "street", "city", "state", "zip_code", "house_size", "prev_sold_date"])

# Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
Q1 = df["price"].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df["price"].quantile(0.75)

# Calculate IQR
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Define outliers as those below (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) or above (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Identify outliers
outliers = df[(df["price"] < lower_bound) | (df["price"] > upper_bound)]

# Print outliers
print(outliers)
```

This code will output the rows in the dataset that are considered outliers based on the IQR method.
