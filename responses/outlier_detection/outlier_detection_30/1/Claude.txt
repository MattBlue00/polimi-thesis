I'll help you detect outliers in the numerical columns of this dataset. I'll use a common method based on Interquartile Range (IQR), where values falling outside 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3 are considered outliers.

Here are the outliers detected in key numerical columns:

Price:
- Very high outliers: Values above $2,450,000
  Notable examples: $14,335,800, $20,368,700, $20,018,200
- Very low outliers: Values below $100,000
  Notable examples: $4,600, $8,100, $10,300

Bedrooms:
- High outliers: Values above 8 bedrooms
  Several properties with 10-12 bedrooms appear to be outliers
- The normal range appears to be 3-5 bedrooms

Bathrooms:
- High outliers: Values above 6 bathrooms
  Several properties with 8-12 bathrooms appear to be outliers
- The normal range appears to be 2-4 bathrooms

Lot Size (acres):
- High outliers: Values above 1 acre
  Notable examples: 63.0, 69.0, 68.0 acres
- Most properties are under 0.5 acres

House Size (sq ft):
- High outliers: Values above 5,000 sq ft
  Notable examples: 9,029, 11,420, 10,590 sq ft
- Very low outliers: Values below 500 sq ft
  Notable examples: 59, 79, 14 sq ft
- The normal range appears to be between 1,000-3,000 sq ft

Some specific observations:
1. There are several properties with extremely high prices (>$10M) that are clear outliers
2. Some properties have unusually high numbers of bedrooms/bathrooms that may be data errors
3. There are some very small house sizes (<100 sq ft) that should be verified for accuracy
4. Several properties have extremely large lot sizes (>50 acres) compared to the typical urban/suburban lot

Would you like me to perform a more detailed statistical analysis on any particular aspect of this data?
