Outlier detection on this dataset requires a multi-pronged approach due to the mixed data types (numerical and categorical) and the different scales of the numerical features. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, along with Python code using Pandas and Scikit-learn:

**1. Data Loading and Preparation:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")  # Replace "your_data.csv" with your file name

# Convert prev_sold_date to datetime
data['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['prev_sold_date'])

# Features for outlier detection (excluding categorical for now)
numeric_features = ['price', 'bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size']
```

**2. Handling Categorical Features:**

For categorical features like `city`, `state`, `street`, `zip_code`, and `status`, direct outlier detection is tricky.  We can't calculate distances or use standard deviation.  Here are some options:

* **Frequency-based analysis:**  Identify infrequent categories. These *could* be outliers, but might also be valid rare occurrences.
* **Target encoding (if applicable):** If you have a target variable (e.g., predicting price), you could replace categories with the average target value for that category. This converts categorical data to numerical, making it usable in outlier detection models.
* **One-hot encoding:**  Create dummy variables for each category.  This can be problematic with high cardinality (many unique categories) as it increases dimensionality.  It's less useful for outlier detection directly, but can be used in conjunction with other methods.

For this example, we'll focus on the numerical features, but keep in mind that incorporating categorical information can improve outlier detection.

**3. Outlier Detection Methods (Numerical Features):**

* **Isolation Forest:**  Good for high-dimensional data and doesn't assume a normal distribution.

```python
# Isolate the numeric features
data_numeric = data[numeric_features]

# Scale the data (important for Isolation Forest)
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_numeric)

# Apply Isolation Forest
iso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination='auto', random_state=42) # 'auto' estimates contamination based on data
outliers = iso_forest.fit_predict(data_scaled)

# Add outlier predictions back to the original dataframe
data['outlier_iso'] = outliers
```

* **IQR (Interquartile Range):**  Simple and effective for single variables.  Less sensitive to extreme values than standard deviation.  We'll demonstrate this for the 'price' feature:

```python
Q1 = data['price'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data['price'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

data['outlier_price_iqr'] = (data['price'] < lower_bound) | (data['price'] > upper_bound)
```

**4. Examining Results:**

```python
# View potential outliers identified by Isolation Forest
print(data[data['outlier_iso'] == -1])

# View potential outliers identified by IQR for price
print(data[data['outlier_price_iqr'] == True])
```

**5. Interpretation and Next Steps:**

* **No single "correct" answer:** Outlier detection is subjective.  Review the identified outliers carefully.  Are they genuine errors, or just unusual but valid data points?
* **Domain knowledge is crucial:**  Understanding the context of your data is essential for interpreting the results.  For example, a house with 12 bedrooms might be an outlier statistically, but could be a valid data point (e.g., a large multi-family property).
* **Further investigation:**  If you identify potential outliers, investigate them further.  Check for data entry errors, or look for explanations for unusual values.
* **Consider other methods:**  Experiment with different outlier detection techniques (e.g., Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM) to see if they provide different insights.

This comprehensive approach will help you identify potential outliers in your dataset. Remember to carefully review the results and use your domain knowledge to determine the best course of action.  Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these methods in more detail or want to try other techniques.
