Yes, I can perform outlier detection on the given dataset. However, I am not able to directly display or process the data in real-time. To detect outliers, we typically use statistical methods such as the Z-score method, the IQR (Interquartile Range) method, or more advanced techniques like DBSCAN or Isolation Forest if you have a specific algorithm in mind. If you provide me with the dataset or specify which columns you would like to analyze for outliers, I can guide you through the process or even execute the code for you.
