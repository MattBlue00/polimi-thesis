I'll help you detect outliers in the numerical columns of this dataset. I'll use a common method based on Interquartile Range (IQR), where values falling outside 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3 are considered outliers. Here are the notable outliers:

Price:
- Very high outliers: $20,189,200, $21,756,100, $8,301,300, $6,107,900
- Very low outliers: $2,500, $11,400, $25,000, $28,100

Bedrooms:
- High outliers: 11, 12, 10, 8 bedrooms
- Most homes have 2-4 bedrooms

Bathrooms:
- High outliers: 12, 11, 10, 8 bathrooms
- Most homes have 1-3 bathrooms

Lot Size (acres):
- High outliers: 69.0, 53.0, 48.0, 35.0, 27.59 acres
- Most properties are under 1 acre

House Size (sq ft):
- High outliers: 10,470, 9,698, 9,629, 8,940 sq ft
- Low outliers: 16, 97, 130, 140 sq ft
- Most homes are between 1,000-3,000 sq ft

Some observations:
1. There appear to be some data quality issues, particularly with extremely low house sizes (16 sq ft is unrealistic)
2. The price outliers are extremely high, suggesting either luxury properties or possible data errors
3. Some properties have unusually high numbers of bedrooms/bathrooms
4. There are some very large lot sizes that are likely rural properties

Would you like me to perform a more detailed statistical analysis on any particular aspect of this data?
