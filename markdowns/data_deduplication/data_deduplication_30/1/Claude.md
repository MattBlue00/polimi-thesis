I'll help identify and remove duplicate entries. A record can be considered a duplicate if it has the same values across key fields. Let me analyze the data and remove duplicates based on matching address (street, city, state) and other key characteristics.

Here are some clear duplicates I found:

1. Property at "272 Terrace Ln, Orlando, Florida" (brokered_by: 687) appears 3 times
2. Property at "864 Lake Ln, Irving, Texas" (brokered_by: 3479) appears 3 times
3. Property at "219 Field St, Houston, Texas" (brokered_by: 16829) appears 2 times
4. Property at "611 Hill Pl, Wichita, Kansas" (brokered_by: 53556) appears 2 times
5. Property at "162 Mill St, Tustin, California" (brokered_by: 84529) appears 2 times
6. Property at "88 East Ave, San Antonio, Texas" (brokered_by: 48807) appears 2 times

There are also some entries that appear to be the same property but have slight variations in spelling or data entry errors. For example:
- "693 Ridge Pl, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia" and "693 Ridge, Harpers F., West-Virginia"
- "59 Park Blvd, Meridian, Idaho" and "59 Park, Meridiano, Idao"
- "63 Field Dr, Sumter, South Carolina" and "63 Fild Dr, Soumter, Sud Carolina"

To clean this dataset, we should:
1. Remove the exact duplicates
2. Review and standardize entries that appear to be the same property but have spelling variations
3. Verify and correct obvious typos in state names and addresses

Would you like me to provide a cleaned version of the dataset with these corrections made?
