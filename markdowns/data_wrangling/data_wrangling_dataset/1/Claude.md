I'll help you analyze and clean this real estate dataset. Here are some data wrangling operations we can perform:

1. Basic Statistics:
- Total number of records: 89 properties
- Status breakdown: Mix of 'for_sale' and 'sold' properties
- Price range: $69,900 to $2,450,000
- Bedroom range: 1-6 bedrooms
- Bathroom range: 1-6 bathrooms

2. Data Quality Checks:
- No missing values detected
- Currency is consistent ($)
- Zip codes are properly formatted
- Date components (month/day/year) are separated

3. Potential Transformations:
- Combine prev_sold_month, prev_sold_day, prev_sold_year into a single date column
- Create price per square foot column
- Categorize properties by size/price ranges
- Create address components (street, city, state)

4. Interesting Insights:
- Lot sizes range from 0.03 to 35 acres
- House sizes range from 321 to 5,828 square feet
- Most common broker first names: Anthony, Jack, Helen
- Most properties are 3 bed/2 bath configurations

Would you like me to perform any specific analysis or transformation on this dataset?
