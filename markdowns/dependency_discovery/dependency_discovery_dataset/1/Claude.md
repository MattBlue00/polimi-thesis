I'll help analyze functional dependencies in this dataset. Let me check for some potential dependencies:

1. brokered_by → No other attributes
   (Same broker ID can list different properties)

2. street, city, state → zip_code
   (A specific address should determine its ZIP code)

3. zip_code ↛ city, state
   (One ZIP code could span multiple cities, though rare)

4. {street, city, state} → {price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size}
   (A unique address should determine the property's characteristics)

5. price ↛ Any other attributes
   (Same price can apply to different properties)

6. {bed, bath, house_size} ↛ price
   (Similar houses can have different prices based on location and other factors)

7. status ↛ Any other attributes
   (Properties with similar characteristics can have different statuses)

8. prev_sold_date ↛ Any other attributes
   (Same sale date can apply to multiple properties)

Key observations:
1. The natural key appears to be the combination of {street, city, state}
2. brokered_by appears to be an artificial identifier but doesn't determine other attributes
3. Most attributes are independent of each other
4. There are very few strict functional dependencies in this real estate dataset, which is typical for this type of data

The main functional dependency appears to be:
- {street, city, state} → {zip_code, price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size}

This makes sense as a unique address should determine the physical characteristics of a property at a given point in time.
