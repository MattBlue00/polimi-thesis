I'll help you detect outliers in the numerical columns of this dataset. I'll use a common method based on Interquartile Range (IQR), where values falling outside 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3 are considered outliers. Here are the notable outliers:

1. Price:
- Very high outliers: Several properties above $10M including $14,335,800, $20,368,700, $20,018,200
- Very low outliers: Several properties under $30,000 including $8,100, $4,600

2. Number of Bedrooms (bed):
- High outliers: Several properties with 10-12 bedrooms
- Normal range appears to be 2-5 bedrooms

3. Number of Bathrooms (bath):
- High outliers: Several properties with 10-12 bathrooms
- Normal range appears to be 2-4 bathrooms

4. Lot Size (acre_lot):
- High outliers: Several properties with 60+ acres (63.0, 69.0, 68.0 acres)
- Normal range appears to be under 1 acre

5. House Size (house_size):
- High outliers: Several properties over 9,000 sq ft (11,420, 10,590, 10,300 sq ft)
- Very low outliers: Properties under 100 sq ft (14, 39, 59 sq ft)

Some particularly suspicious data points that might need verification:
1. Properties with extremely low prices but large sizes
2. Properties with unusually high bathroom-to-bedroom ratios
3. Properties with very small house sizes (under 100 sq ft) which might be data entry errors
4. Properties with extremely high prices in areas where such prices would be unusual

Would you like me to perform a more detailed statistical analysis on any particular aspect of this data?
