Outlier detection is a crucial step in data analysis to identify data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. In this dataset, we can perform outlier detection on several numerical columns, such as `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size`. Here are some common methods to detect outliers:

1. **Z-Score Method**: This method calculates the Z-score for each data point, which measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A common threshold is a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3.

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**: This method uses the IQR to identify outliers. Data points that fall below \(Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR\) or above \(Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR\) are considered outliers, where \(Q1\) and \(Q3\) are the first and third quartiles, respectively.

3. **Visualization**: Box plots and scatter plots can visually identify outliers.

Let's apply the IQR method to the `price` column as an example:

### Step-by-Step IQR Method for `price`:

1. **Calculate Q1 and Q3**:
   - Sort the `price` data.
   - Find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).

2. **Calculate IQR**:
   - \(IQR = Q3 - Q1\).

3. **Determine Outlier Boundaries**:
   - Lower bound: \(Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR\).
   - Upper bound: \(Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR\).

4. **Identify Outliers**:
   - Any data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier.

### Example Calculation:

1. **Sort the `price` data** and find Q1 and Q3.
2. **Calculate IQR**: Suppose Q1 is 250,000 and Q3 is 5,000,000, then \(IQR = 5,000,000 - 250,000 = 4,750,000\).
3. **Determine Outlier Boundaries**:
   - Lower bound: \(250,000 - 1.5 \times 4,750,000 = -6,875,000\) (since price cannot be negative, consider 0).
   - Upper bound: \(5,000,000 + 1.5 \times 4,750,000 = 12,125,000\).

4. **Identify Outliers**:
   - Any `price` greater than 12,125,000 is an outlier.

### Observations:

- Prices like 23,618,000 and 21,562,200 are outliers based on this calculation.
- Similarly, you can apply the same method to other columns like `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size`.

This approach provides a systematic way to identify outliers, which can then be further analyzed or handled based on the context of the analysis.
