I'll help you standardize this dataset. Here are the main standardization steps we should take:

1. Status column: Convert all variations to consistent values
- 's' and 'f' should be 'for_sale'
- 'sold' remains 'sold'

2. Price column: Remove '$' and ',' to convert to numeric format

3. Bed column: Convert text numbers to numeric
- 'two' -> 2
- 'three' -> 3
- 'four' -> 4
- 'five' -> 5

4. Bath column: Same as bed column

5. State column: Use consistent state abbreviations
- 'California' -> 'CA'
- 'West VA' -> 'WV'
- 'Massachusetts' -> 'MA'
- etc.

6. House_size: Convert scientific notation to regular numbers

7. prev_sold_date: Convert to consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these standardizations? I can provide the standardized dataset or focus on specific columns you're most interested in.
