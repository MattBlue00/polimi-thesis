Data standardization is a process of transforming data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is often done to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the analysis, especially in machine learning algorithms. To standardize the dataset, we need to apply the following formula to each numerical feature:

\[ z = \frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma} \]

Where:
- \( z \) is the standardized value,
- \( x \) is the original value,
- \( \mu \) is the mean of the feature,
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the feature.

Let's go through the steps to standardize the numerical columns in the dataset:

1. **Identify Numerical Columns**: In the given dataset, the numerical columns are `price`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`.

2. **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**: For each numerical column, calculate the mean and standard deviation.

3. **Apply Standardization Formula**: Transform each value in the numerical columns using the standardization formula.

Here's a simplified example of how you might perform this in Python using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
data = {
    'price': [409900, 760000, 490000, 350000, 425000, 370000, 129900, 425000, 239000, 725000],
    'acre_lot': [2.12, 0.36, 0.16, 0.9, 0.06, 0.12, 1.95, 0.83, 0.56, 1.04],
    'house_size': [3.640811524334252e-05, 1888, 2416, 0.0001155016069788797, 7.443038337924701e-05, 2084, 2128, 1368, 1724, 1876]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit and transform the data
standardized_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Convert the standardized data back to a DataFrame
standardized_df = pd.DataFrame(standardized_data, columns=df.columns)

print(standardized_df)
```

This code snippet will standardize the `price`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size` columns. You can extend this process to the entire dataset by including all numerical columns and handling any missing or non-numeric data appropriately.
