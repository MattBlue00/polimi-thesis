I'll help you profile this dataset by analyzing its key characteristics:

1. Basic Information:
- Number of columns: 12
- Column names: brokered_by, status, price, bed, bath, acre_lot, street, city, state, zip_code, house_size, prev_sold_date

2. Data Quality Issues:
- Missing values (nan, -1, Unknown)
- Inconsistent formats (especially in dates, prices, and numbers)
- Mixed data types within columns
- Special characters in addresses
- State abbreviations mixed with full names (TX vs Texas)

3. Column-specific analysis:

- Inconsistent formats (f, s, Unknown, -)

- Contains missing values (nan)
- Range appears to be from around $2,500 to $2,450,000

4. Data Quality Recommendations:
- Standardize date formats
- Clean price values to numeric format
- Standardize state names/abbreviations
- Validate and clean numeric fields
- Handle missing values consistently
- Standardize status categories
- Clean and validate zip codes
- Convert text numbers to numeric format

This dataset would benefit from significant cleaning and standardization before analysis.
