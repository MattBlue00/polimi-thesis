I'll help you standardize this dataset. Here are the main issues I notice and how we should standardize them:

1. Status values: There are inconsistent representations ('sold', 's', 'for_sale', 'f')
2. Price format: Some have '$' prefix and some don't
3. Bedroom/Bathroom counts: Some are written as numbers, others as text ('three', 'two')
4. House size: Some values are in decimal notation
5. Date format: Inconsistent (MM/DD/YY vs YYYY-MM-DD)
6. State names: Mix of full names and abbreviations
7. Address format: Some have quotes and commas

Here's how we should standardize each:

1. Status: Convert all to either 'sold' or 'for_sale'
2. Price: Remove '$' and convert all to plain numbers
3. Bed/Bath: Convert text numbers to digits
4. House size: Convert to standard square footage
5. Dates: Convert all to YYYY-MM-DD format
6. State names: Use standard two-letter abbreviations
7. Address: Remove quotes and standardize format

Would you like me to provide the standardized dataset, or would you prefer to focus on specific aspects of the standardization?
