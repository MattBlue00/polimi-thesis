Dependency discovery involves identifying relationships and dependencies between different attributes in a dataset. In the context of a real estate dataset like the one you provided, we can explore potential dependencies or relationships between various attributes. Here are some possible dependencies or relationships that might exist in this dataset:

1. **Price and House Size**: There is often a correlation between the price of a property and its size. Larger houses tend to be more expensive.

2. **Price and Location (City/State/Zip Code)**: The location of a property can significantly influence its price. Properties in more desirable or urban areas tend to have higher prices.

3. **Price and Number of Bedrooms/Bathrooms**: Generally, properties with more bedrooms and bathrooms are priced higher.

4. **Status and Price**: The status of a property (sold or for sale) might have a relationship with its price. For example, properties that are sold might have different pricing trends compared to those still on the market.

5. **Acre Lot and Price**: The size of the lot can also affect the price, with larger lots potentially commanding higher prices.

6. **Brokered By and Status**: There might be a relationship between the broker handling the property and its sale status, although this is more speculative without additional context.

7. **Prev Sold Date and Price**: The previous sale date might influence the current price, especially if the market has changed significantly since the last sale.

8. **State and Zip Code**: There is a functional dependency between state and zip code, as each zip code is associated with a specific state.

9. **Street and City/State/Zip Code**: The street address is dependent on the city, state, and zip code, as these collectively define the location.

These are just some potential dependencies that could be explored further with statistical analysis or data mining techniques. Identifying these dependencies can help in understanding the factors that influence property prices and other attributes in the real estate market.
