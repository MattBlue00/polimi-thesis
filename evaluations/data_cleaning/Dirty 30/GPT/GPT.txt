Certainly! Data cleaning involves addressing various issues such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and incorrect data types. Here's a step-by-step approach to clean the dataset:

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate rows based on unique identifiers or a combination of columns.

2. **Handle Missing Values**: Decide how to handle missing values. Options include:
   - Dropping rows with missing critical information (e.g., `price`, `status`).
   - Imputing missing values with mean, median, or mode for numerical columns.
   - Filling missing categorical values with the most frequent category or a placeholder like "Unknown".

3. **Standardize Data Formats**: Ensure consistency in data formats, such as:
   - Converting `price` to a numerical format by removing currency symbols and handling non-numeric entries.
   - Standardizing date formats in `prev_sold_date`.

4. **Correct Data Types**: Convert columns to appropriate data types:
   - Convert `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, and `house_size` to numeric types.
   - Convert `zip_code` to string if it contains leading zeros.

5. **Address Inconsistent Entries**: Correct inconsistent entries, such as:
   - Standardizing entries like "two", "three", "four" to numeric values in `bed` and `bath`.
   - Handling negative or zero values in columns like `price`, `house_size`, and `acre_lot`.

6. **Remove Irrelevant or Erroneous Data**: Remove rows with clearly erroneous data, such as negative prices or house sizes.
